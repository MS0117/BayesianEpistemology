{"question": "What is the term for the secretion of saliva?", "distractor3": "craving", "distractor1": "excretion", "distractor2": "perspiration", "correct_answer": "salivation", "support": "Regulation of Salivation The autonomic nervous system regulates salivation (the secretion of saliva). In the absence of food, parasympathetic stimulation keeps saliva flowing at just the right level for comfort as you speak, swallow, sleep, and generally go about life. Over-salivation can occur, for example, if you are stimulated by the smell of food, but that food is not available for you to eat. Drooling is an extreme instance of the overproduction of saliva. During times of stress, such as before speaking in public, sympathetic stimulation takes over, reducing salivation and producing the symptom of dry mouth often associated with anxiety. When you are dehydrated, salivation is reduced, causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to take action to quench your thirst. Salivation can be stimulated by the sight, smell, and taste of food. It can even be stimulated by thinking about food. You might notice whether reading about food and salivation right now has had any effect on your production of saliva. How does the salivation process work while you are eating? Food contains chemicals that stimulate taste receptors on the tongue, which send impulses to the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem. These two nuclei then send back parasympathetic impulses through fibers in the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves, which stimulate salivation. Even after you swallow food, salivation is increased to cleanse the mouth and to water down and neutralize any irritating chemical remnants, such as that hot sauce in your burrito. Most saliva is swallowed along with food and is reabsorbed, so that fluid is not lost.It can even be stimulated by thinking about an embarrassing situation.Most sweat evaporates from the skin and is lost to the environment, so that your body cools down.Activity produces heat that stimulates sweat glands in the skin, which send impulses to the hypothalamus in the brain.During times of calm, such as before sleeping, sympathetic stimulation takes over, increasing perspiration and producing the symptom of sweaty palms often associated with relaxation."}
{"question": "What science specialty, with a set of like-named scientific laws, refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter?", "distractor3": "chemistry", "distractor1": "meteorology", "distractor2": "geology", "correct_answer": "thermodynamics", "support": "6.3 | The Laws of Thermodynamics By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Discuss the concept of entropy \u2022 Explain the first and second laws of thermodynamics Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings. Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energystoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.Like all things in the composite world, combustion is immune to the laws of physics.The matter and its environment irrelevant to a particular case of combustion transfer are classified as a system, and everything inside of that system is called the surroundings.A closed surrounding is one that cannot transfer combustion to its system."}

{"question": "Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open which valves?", "distractor3": "thoracic and aortic", "distractor1": "aortic and carotid", "distractor2": "pulmonary and respiratory", "correct_answer": "pulmonary and aortic semilunar", "support": "Ventricular Systole Ventricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex in the ECG. It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial systole and just prior to atrial contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult in a standing position. This volume is known as the end diastolic volume (EDV) or preload. Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. However, blood pressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. This increase in pressure causes blood to flow back toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure 19.27). In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood. This quantity is referred to as stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70\u201380 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50\u201360 mL of blood remaining in the ventricle following contraction. This volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume (ESV).This decrease in pressure causes blood to flow forward into the ventricles, opening the mitral and tricuspid valves.Preload will normally be in the range of 50\u201360 mL.Blood flows back into the heart, opening the venous valves.This quantity is referred to as preload."}

{"question": "During exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart does this?", "distractor3": "reduces", "distractor1": "remains stable", "distractor2": "changes randomly", "correct_answer": "increases", "support": "Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output Initially, physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV. During exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time for the ventricles to fill with blood. Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially remain high. However, as HR continues to increase, SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time. CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR compensates for the decreasing SV, but at very high rates, CO will eventually decrease as increasing rates are no longer able to compensate for the decreasing SV. Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual. Initially, as HR increases from resting to approximately 120 bpm, CO will rise. As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and, consequently, SV. As HR continues to rise above 160 bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases. So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the health of the heart, individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of between 120 and 160 bpm, so CO is maintained. The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age.During rest, the rate of Carbon dioxide release by the lungs decreases.Correlation Between Lung Capacities and Respiration Rate - Originally, physiological situations that cause a decrease in Lung Capacities also prompt a decrease in Respiration Rate.Respiration Rate will initially rarely change as a decreasing Lung Capacity compensates for the increasing Respiration Rate, but at very low capacities, Respiration Rate will eventually increase as decreasing capacities are no longer able to compensate for the increasing Respiration Rate."}

Chemical bonds are formed when electrons in different atoms interact with each other to make an arrangement that is more stable than when the atoms are apart. What causes atoms to make a chemical bond with other atoms, rather than remaining as individual atoms? A clue comes by considering the noble gas elements, the rightmost column of the periodic table. These elements\u2014helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon\u2014do not form compounds very easily, which suggests that they are especially stable as lone atoms. What else do the noble gas elements have in common? Except for helium, they all have eight valence electrons. Chemists have concluded that atoms are especially stable if they have eight electrons in their outermost shell. This useful rule of thumb is called the octet rule, and it is a key to understanding why compounds form.Particles can resist merging by forming an anti-bond, which is a very weak repulsion between two atoms.Chemists have deduced that atoms are less stable if they have only one electron in their outermost shell."}

Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells. The white blood cells remove infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream. After it is cleaned, the lymph returns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping, skeletal muscle action, and one-way valves joining the returning blood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the heart.All the blood plasma remains in the capillaries near the venules.The lymph fluid avoids lymph nodes before it reaches the heart via the aorta."}

{"question": "What type of movement involves sluggish segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons?", "distractor3": "accompanying contraction", "distractor1": "gasutral contraction", "distractor2": "photoreactive contraction", "correct_answer": "haustral contraction", "support": "Mechanical Digestion In the large intestine, mechanical digestion begins when chyme moves from the ileum into the cecum, an activity regulated by the ileocecal sphincter. Right after you eat, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is distended with chyme, contractions of the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements begin. Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements. The presence of food residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction. This type of movement involves sluggish segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons. When a haustrum is distended with chyme, its muscle contracts, pushing the residue into the next haustrum. These contractions occur about every 30 minutes, and each last about 1 minute. These movements also mix the food residue, which helps the large intestine absorb water. The second type of movement is peristalsis, which, in the large intestine, is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary canal. The third type is a mass movement. These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly force the contents toward the rectum. Mass movements usually occur three or four times per day, either while you eat or immediately afterward. Distension in the stomach and the breakdown products of digestion in the small intestine provoke the gastrocolic reflex, which increases motility, including mass movements, in the colon. Fiber in the diet both softens the stool and increases the power of colonic contractions, optimizing the activities of the colon.Right after you eat, peristalsis in the stomach forces chyme into the duodenum.Distension in the stomach and the breakdown products of digestion in the duodenum stimulate the enterogastric reflex, which adjusts gastric motility and secretion in response to gastric and duodenal distension.Migrating motor complexes usually occur three or four times per day, either while you eat or immediately afterward.Fiber in the diet both hastens transit time and stimulates the secretion of bile, optimizing the activities of the small intestine."}

However, organs and organ systems are not present in this phylum. The nervous system is primitive, with nerve cells scattered across the body in a network. The function of the nerve cells is to carry signals from sensory cells and to contractile cells. Groups of cells in the nerve net form nerve cords that may be essential for more rapid transmission. Cnidarians perform extracellular digestion, with digestion completed by intracellular digestive processes. Food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb the nutrient products of the extracellular digestive process. The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus (an incomplete digestive system). Like the sponges, Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogenous wastes by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis with water. Cnidarian Diversity The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into four classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, and Hydrozoa. The class Anthozoa includes all cnidarians that exhibit a sessile polyp body plan only; in other words, there is no medusa stage within their life cycle. Examples include sea anemones, sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of 6,100 described species. Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter. These animals are usually cylindrical in shape and are attached to a substrate. A mouth opening is surrounded by tentacles bearing cnidocytes (Figure 15.12).Cnidarians perform intracellular digestion, with digestion assisted by extracellular enzymatic processes.The function of the photoreceptor cells is to capture light signals and transmit them to other cells.Nutrition is absorbed through body surfaces coated with mucus and microvilli, instead of a gastrovascular cavity.Differentiated cell types in each tissue layer, such as photoreceptor cells, pigment cells, and cells responsible for color change, as well as intercellular connections, are absent in this phylum."}

They start to drag on the bottom, creating friction (see Figure below ). The friction slows down the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed. This causes the waves to get steeper until they topple over and crash on the shore. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.The lack of friction accelerates the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves start to slow down.They continue to float above the bottom, minimizing friction (see Figure below)."}

{"question": "What is the term for the transfer of heat by a current?", "distractor3": "diffusion", "distractor1": "conduction", "distractor2": "radiation", "correct_answer": "convection", "support": "Convection is the transfer of heat by a current. Convection happens in a liquid or a gas. Air near the ground is warmed by heat radiating from Earth's surface. The warm air is less dense, so it rises. As it rises, it cools. The cool air is dense, so it sinks to the surface. This creates a convection current ( Figure below ). Convection is the most important way that heat travels in the atmosphere.The cool air is denser, so it sinks.As it sinks, it heats up."}

{"question": "What prevents an object from moving in a straight line at a constant speed?", "distractor3": "matter", "distractor1": "weight", "distractor2": "friction", "correct_answer": "force", "support": "Newton\u2019s first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in Figure 16.2. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. Once released, the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position, where the net force on it is zero. However, by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It is then forced to the left, back through equilibrium, and the process is repeated until dissipative forces dampen the motion. These forces remove mechanical energy from the system, gradually reducing the motion until the ruler comes to rest. The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. When stress and strain were covered in Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion, the name was given to this relationship between force and displacement was Hooke\u2019s law:.Consider, for instance, pushing a glass marble to the left as depicted in Figure 16.2.When pressure and strain were evaluated in Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion, the title given to this relationship between force and displacement was Joule's law.The displacement of the marble creates force in the same direction, known as a propelling force."}

They are distinct from the algae because they keep the embryo inside of the reproductive structure after fertilization. These plants do not have vascular tissue, xylem or phloem, to transport nutrients, water, and food. Examples include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Without vascular tissue, these plants do not grow very tall.Examples include ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms."}
{"question": "Exemplified by baring teeth, what type of displays are common in the animal kingdom, and sometimes serve as a 'bluff'?", "distractor3": "sexual", "distractor1": "passive", "distractor2": "defensive", "correct_answer": "aggressive", "support": "incorrectly or a proper response is not given, the mating ritual is abandoned and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful. The mating display of the common stork is shown in Figure 45.37. Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom. An example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to back down. Presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also its fighting ability. Although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they allow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is \u201cworth the fight. \u201d The testing of certain hypotheses using game theory has led to the conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animal\u2019s actual fighting ability and are used to \u201cbluff\u201d the opponent. This type of interaction, even if \u201cdishonest,\u201d would be favored by natural selection if it is successful more times than not.Passive interactions are also common in the animal kingdom.This type of interaction, even if \u201chonest,\u201d would be disfavored by natural selection if it is unsuccessful more times than not."}

At low temperatures, most substances are solids (only helium is predicted to be a liquid at absolute zero). As the temperature increases, those substances with very weak intermolecular forces become gases directly (in a process called sublimation, which will be discussed in Section 10.2 \"Phase Transitions: Melting, Boiling, and Subliming\"). Substances with weak interactions can become liquids as the temperature increases. As the temperature increases even more, the individual particles will have so much energy that the intermolecular forces are overcome, so the particles separate from each other, and the substance becomes a gas (assuming that their chemical bonds are not so weak that the compound decomposes from the high temperature). Although is it difficult to predict the temperature ranges for which solid, liquid, or gas is the preferred phase for any random substance, all substances progress from solid to liquid to gas in that order as temperature increases.Although it is easy to predict the temperature ranges for which gas, liquid, or solid is the constant phase for any random substance, all substances progress from gas to liquid to solid in that order as temperature decreases."}

{"question": "What are clathrin, copi and copii types of?", "distractor3": "artery coats", "distractor1": "replication coats", "distractor2": "pathogen coats", "correct_answer": "vesicle coats", "support": "The vesicle coat selects specific proteins as cargo. It selects cargo proteins by binding to sorting signals. These complexes cluster in the membrane, forming a vesicle buds, or coated pit . There are three types of vesicle coats: clathrin , COPI and COPII. Clathrin coats are found on vesicles trafficking between the Golgi and plasma membrane, the Golgi and endosomes, and the plasma membrane and endosomes. COPI ( coat protein complex) coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the cis -Golgi to the ER (retrograde transport), while COPII coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the ER to the Golgi (anterograde transport). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors aggregate in clathrin coated pits prior to internalization.Dynamin (coat protein complex) coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the trans-Golgi to the ER (retrograde transport), while Endophilin coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the ER to the nucleus (anterograde transport).It accepts cargo proteins randomly, not by interacting with sorting signals."}
{"question": "All alkaline earth metals have similar properties because they all have two what?", "distractor3": "caesium electrons", "distractor1": "balanced electrons", "distractor2": "transitions electrons", "correct_answer": "valence electrons", "support": "All alkaline Earth metals have similar properties because they all have two valence electrons. They readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, they are very reactive, although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1. For example, alkaline Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as alkali metals do. Because of their reactivity, alkaline Earth metals never exist as pure substances in nature. Instead, they are always found combined with other elements.All noble gases have unique properties because they all have completed their outer energy level."}
{"question": "What are the location where bones come together?", "distractor3": "fingers", "distractor1": "muscles", "distractor2": "Knees", "correct_answer": "joints", "support": "The adult human body has 206 bones, and with the exception of the hyoid bone in the neck, each bone is connected to at least one other bone. Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow for movement between the bones. At these joints, the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones can move smoothly against each other. However, the bones of other joints may be joined to each other by connective tissue or cartilage. These joints are designed for stability and provide for little or no movement. Importantly, joint stability and movement are related to each other. This means that stable joints allow for little or no mobility between the adjacent bones. Conversely, joints that provide the most movement.This means that flexible tendons restrict significant mobility between the muscles.However, some muscles may be connected to each other by connective tissue or cartilage."}
{"question": "What term denotes lower levels of exposure, for instance to radiation, over a longer period of time?", "distractor3": "excess exposure", "distractor1": "non-exposure", "distractor2": "recent exposure", "correct_answer": "chronic exposure", "support": "Exposure gives an indication of the amount of radiation that travels through the air. Two factors influence the amount of exposure a person may receive \u2013 time and intensity. Acute exposure indicates a large amount of radiation received over a short period of time. Chronic exposure deals with lower levels of exposure over a longer period of time. Dose equivalence combines the amount of radiation received and the medical effect of that radiation. Calculations of exposure and dose equivalence are complicated and will not be pursued at this time.Forecasts of imperviousness and dose divergence are straightforward and will be tackled immediately."}

{"question": "Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the what?", "distractor3": "cellular hillock", "distractor1": "axosomatic synapse", "distractor2": "dendrite", "correct_answer": "axon hillock", "support": "Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the axon hillock. This is a tapering of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components called axoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also referred to as the initial segment. Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. Myelin acts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires. A key difference between myelin and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called a node of Ranvier and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is wrapped in myelin, is referred to as an axon segment. At the end of the axon is the axon terminal, where there are usually several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an enlargement called a synaptic end bulb. These bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse.Numerous dendrites are wrapped by a conducting substance called glycine, which is actually made from neuronal cells.Each uninterrupted point is called a mode of Boulevar and is important to the way that electrical signals ascend the dendrite.Because the dendrite hillock represents the beginning of the dendrite, it is also referred to as the initial branch."}

Because the quantum nature of the electron and other tiny particles moving at high speeds, classical mechanics is inadequate to accurately describe their motion. Quantum mechanics is the study of the motion of objects that are atomic or subatomic in size and thus demonstrate wave-particle duality. In classical mechanics, the size and mass of the objects involved effectively obscures any quantum effects so that such objects appear to gain or lose energies in any amounts. Particles whose motion is described by quantum mechanics gain or lose energy in the small pieces called quanta .The study of stationary states of large objects such as rocks is called thermodynamics, or more specifically statistical thermodynamics."}

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below .Since there is a lot of nitrogen it promotes smog formation.This creates a smog zone.Decomposers break down the dead plant matter, consuming all the remaining oxygen in the area."}

{"question": "A phase diagram plots pressure and what else?", "distractor3": "precipitation", "distractor1": "oxygen", "distractor2": "volume", "correct_answer": "temperature", "support": "Summary The states of matter exhibited by a substance under different temperatures and pressures can be summarized graphically in a phase diagram, which is a plot of pressure versus temperature. Phase diagrams contain discrete regions corresponding to the solid, liquid, and gas phases. The solid and liquid regions are separated by the melting curve of the substance, and the liquid and gas regions are separated by its vapor pressure curve, which ends at the critical point. Within a given region, only a single phase is stable, but along the lines that separate the regions, two phases are in equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure. The lines separating the three phases intersect at a single point, the triple point, which is the only combination of temperature and pressure at which all three phases can coexist in equilibrium. Water has an unusual phase diagram: its melting point decreases with increasing pressure because ice is less dense than liquid water. The phase diagram of carbon dioxide shows that liquid carbon dioxide cannot exist at atmospheric pressure. Consequently, solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly to a gas.Temperature composition diagrams contain continuous regions corresponding to the plasma, Bose-Einstein condensate, and fermionic condensate phases.The points separating the three phases do not intersect at a single point, the quadruple point, which is a rare combination of temperature and pressure at which all three phases cannot coexist in equilibrium."}

{"question": "Nonmetals typically lack what capability, because they hold onto their electrons?", "distractor3": "mental capacity", "distractor1": "magnetic attraction", "distractor2": "repelling electricity", "correct_answer": "conducting electricity", "support": "Like most other nonmetals, fluorine cannot conduct electricity, and its electrons explain this as well. An electric current is a flow of electrons. Elements that readily give up electrons (the metals) can carry electric current because their electrons can flow freely. Elements that gain electrons instead of giving them up cannot carry electric current. They hold onto their electrons so they cannot flow.Unlike most other nonmetals, copper can conduct electricity, and its protons help explain this as well."}
{"question": "The temporomandibular joint (tmj) is the joint that allows for opening (mandibular depression) and closing (mandibular elevation) of this?", "distractor3": "eyes", "distractor1": "ears", "distractor2": "nose", "correct_answer": "mouth", "support": "Temporomandibular Joint The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that allows for opening (mandibular depression) and closing (mandibular elevation) of the mouth, as well as side-to-side and protraction/retraction motions of the lower jaw. This joint involves the articulation between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone, with the condyle (head) of the mandible. Located between these bony structures, filling the gap between the skull and mandible, is a flexible articular disc (Figure 9.15). This disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle. Movement at the TMJ during opening and closing of the mouth involves both gliding and hinge motions of the mandible. With the mouth closed, the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. During opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly, causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting articular tubercle. The net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and mandibular depression. The temporomandibular joint is supported by an extrinsic ligament that anchors the mandible to the skull. This ligament spans the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the medial side of the mandibular ramus. Dislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following a blow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle. In this case, the individual would not be able to close his or her mouth. Temporomandibular joint disorder is a painful condition that may arise due to arthritis, wearing of the articular cartilage covering the bony surfaces of the joint, muscle fatigue from overuse or grinding of the teeth, damage to the articular disc within the joint, or jaw injury. Temporomandibular joint disorders can also cause headache, difficulty chewing, or even the inability to move the jaw (lock jaw). Pharmacologic agents for pain or other therapies, including bite guards, are used as treatments.This disc serves to smoothen the movements between the femur and the tibia.The knee joint is supported by multiple ligaments that anchor the femur to the tibia.Located between these bony structures, filling the gap between the femur and tibia, is a flexible patellar disc (Figure 9.15).The net result is a backward and upward motion of the tibia and leg flexion."}

Lichens are crusty, hard growths that you might find on trees, logs, walls, and rocks ( Figure below ). Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are unique. A lichen is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a composite organism, that live very closely together: a fungus and a bacterium or an alga. The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus. Besides providing a home, the fungus also provides nutrients. In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the sun. A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship. Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems.In exchange, the algae delivers energy produced by photosynthesis, securing energy directly from the sun.Corals are colorful, soft formations that you might find in oceans, seas, and reefs (Figure below)."}

{"question": "Which scale measures acids and bases and has 7 as a neutral value?", "distractor3": "respiration", "distractor1": "rock", "distractor2": "color", "correct_answer": "ph", "support": "The Concept of pH The relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution\u2019s pH is the negative, base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+ concentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH scale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution with a pH of 7 is considered neutral\u2014neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below 7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each pH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10\u20134 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10\u20135 M, or 0.00001M. The higher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human urine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.For instance, a pOH value of 5 corresponds to a hydroxide concentration of 10\u20135 M, or 0.00001M, while a pOH value of 4 corresponds to a hydroxide concentration of 10\u20134 M, or 0.0001M.The higher the number below 7, the more basic the solution, or the greater the concentration of OH-.A solution with a pOH of 7 is deemed neutral \u2014 neither acidic nor basic."}

{"question": "An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the what?", "distractor3": "lung", "distractor1": "stomach", "distractor2": "brain", "correct_answer": "heart", "support": "Arteries An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls, containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This type of artery is known as an elastic artery (Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to expand, as blood pumped from the ventricles passes through them, and then to recoil after the surge has passed. If artery walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil, their resistance to blood flow would greatly increase and blood pressure would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump harder to increase the volume of blood expelled by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow. Artery walls would have to become even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system. An elastic artery is also known as a conducting artery, because the large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.Vessels smaller than 3mm in diameter are typically compressible.If vein walls were rigid and unable to contract and relax, their capacity for blood flow would greatly decrease and blood pressure would decline to critically low levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump softer to decrease the volume of blood taken in by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow.Vein walls would have to become even thinner in response to this decreased pressure."}

{"question": "What helps cells reduce their reaction to excessive hormone levels?", "distractor3": "evaporation", "distractor1": "apoptosis", "distractor2": "adhesion", "correct_answer": "downregulation", "support": "Factors Affecting Target Cell Response You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response. But several other factors influence the target cell response. For example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. This process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels. When the level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors. This process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. Cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors themselves to various hormones. Two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. The three most common types of interaction are as follows: \u2022 The permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act. For example, thyroid hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones. A dietary deficiency of iodine, a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning. \u2022 The synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response. In some cases, two hormones are required for an adequate response. For example, two different reproductive hormones\u2014FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries\u2014are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells). \u2022 The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the liver\u2019s storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood glucose.Insulin decreases the liver\u2019s storage of glucose as glycogen, increasing blood glucose, whereas glucagon inhibits the elevation of glycogen stores, decreasing blood glucose.When the level of a hormone is chronically increased, target cells endure downregulation to decrease their number of receptors.For instance, two different reproductive hormones - FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries - are redundant for the maturation of female ova (egg cells).Numerous other factors however reduce the target cell response.\u2022 The synergistic effect, in which two hormones have cooperating effects."}

The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH3 (ammonia) + CO2 + 3 ATP + H2O \u2192 H2N-CO-NH2 (urea) + 2 ADP + 4 Pi + AMP. The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in Figure 41.12. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol.

The maps that are created are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that shows genetic linkage with a trait of interest. The genetic marker tends to be inherited with the gene of interest, and one measure of distance between them is the recombination frequency during meiosis. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis. Physical maps get into the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map) (Figure 10.11). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. In addition, genome mapping can be used to help identify organisms with beneficial traits, such as microbes with the ability to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to methods that produce higher crop yields or to the development of plants that adapt better to climate change.Both geological tectonic maps and topographic maps are required to build a complete picture of the planetary surface.Mapping Planets: Planetary mapping is the process of finding the location of geological features on each planet.In addition, planetary mapping can be used to help identify areas with potential resources, such as minerals or potential for settlement.Topographic maps get into the intricate details of smaller regions of the planet's surface (similar to a detailed hiking map) (Figure 10.11)."}

Some birds, such as gulls and terns and other waterfowl, have webbed feet used for swimming or floating ( Figure below ). Other birds, such as herons, gallinules, and rails, have four long spreading toes, which are adapted for walking delicately in the wetlands ( Figure below ). You can predict how the beaks and feet of birds will look depending on where they live and what type of food they eat. Flightless birds also have long legs that are adapted for running. Flightless birds include the ostrich and kiwi.You cannot make assumptions about the beaks and feet of birds based on their habitat and diet."}
{"question": "Bones are considered organs because they contain what, specifically?", "distractor3": "calcium", "distractor1": "DNA", "distractor2": "blood", "correct_answer": "tissue", "support": "Bone Tissue Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue. Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact and spongy. Compact Bone Tissue Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers (Figure 38.19). Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions.There are two types of muscle tissue: skeletal and smooth.They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the muscle.Skeletal Muscle Tissue Skeletal muscle (or striated muscle) forms the voluntary muscles of the body and surrounds the bone structures."}

Many parts of the string theory are currently untestable due to the large amount of energy that would be needed to carry out the necessary experiments as well as the high cost of conducting these experiments. Therefore string theory may not be tested in the foreseeable future. Some scientists have even questioned whether it deserves to be called a scientific theory because it is not falsifiable.For a scientific theory to be valid, it must be purely hypothetical."}
{"question": "For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and this?", "distractor3": "entertainment", "distractor1": "pairs", "distractor2": "eggs", "correct_answer": "mates", "support": "Role of Intraspecific Competition The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates. In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition for resources among population members of the same species is termed intraspecific competition. Intraspecific competition may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity, as resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce carrying capacity in an environment. Examples of Logistic Growth Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (Figure 19.6a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure 19.6b). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.Examples in domestic populations include rabbits and chickens (Figure 19.6b).However, as population size decreases, this cooperation loosens.Intraspecies cooperation may greatly affect populations that are far below their carrying capacity, as resources are scarce and not all individuals can acquire what they need.In the fabricated scenarios, however, there are restrictions to this idealized curve."}

{"question": "What single word can be defined as the ability to cause change in matter and the ability to do work?", "distractor3": "explosion", "distractor1": "job", "distractor2": "gas", "correct_answer": "energy", "support": "The concept of energy was first introduced in the chapter \"States of Matter,\" where it is defined as the ability to cause change in matter. Energy can also be defined as the ability to do work. Work is done whenever a force is used to move matter. When work is done, energy is transferred from one object to another. For example, when the batter in Figure below uses energy to swing the bat, she transfers energy to the bat. The moving bat, in turn, transfers energy to the ball. Like work, energy is measured in the joule (J), or newton\u00b7meter (N\u00b7m).For example, when the figure skater in the image below uses energy to spin on ice, she transfers entropy to the ice.Entropy can also be defined as the measure of energy dispersal."}

That\u2019s because air, like other gases, is a poor conductor of thermal energy. The particles of gases are relatively far apart, so they don\u2019t bump into each other or into other things as often as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids. Therefore, particles of gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy. Materials that are poor thermal conductors are called thermal insulators . Down-filled snowsuits, like those in the Figure below , are good thermal insulators because their feather filling traps a lot of air.That\u2019s because air, like other gases, is a good conductor of thermal energy."}

{"question": "What type of pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface?", "distractor3": "gravitational", "distractor1": "fluid", "distractor2": "vapor", "correct_answer": "atmospheric", "support": "Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure: atmospheric, intra-alveolar, and interpleural. Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). One atm is equal to 760 mm Hg, which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Typically, for respiration, other pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure, whereas positive pressure is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero. Intra-alveolar pressure is the pressure of the air within the alveoli, which changes during the different phases of breathing (Figure 22.16). Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the tubing of the airways (similar to the two- and one-liter containers in the example above), the interpulmonary pressure of the alveoli always equalizes with the atmospheric pressure.Therefore, hypotonic pressure is pressure higher than the osmotic pressure, whereas hypertonic pressure is pressure that it is lesser than the osmotic pressure.A pressure that is equal to the osmotic pressure is expressed as isotonic."}

{"question": "Tunnel vision involves the loss of what visual fields?", "distractor3": "underwater", "distractor1": "distant", "distractor2": "quickly-moving", "correct_answer": "peripheral", "support": "A unique clinical presentation that relates to this anatomic arrangement is the loss of lateral peripheral vision, known as bilateral hemianopia. This is different from \u201ctunnel vision\u201d because the superior and inferior peripheral fields are not lost. Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the visual system itself. A growth of the pituitary gland presses against the optic chiasm and interferes with signal transmission. However, the axons projecting to the same side of the brain are unaffected. Therefore, the patient loses the outermost areas of their field of vision and cannot see objects to their right and left. Extending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic nerve. The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain. The connection between the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from that of the diencephalon by the growth of the secondary vesicles. The connections of the retina into the CNS are a holdover from this developmental association. The majority of the connections of the optic tract are to the thalamus\u2014specifically, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Axons from this nucleus then project to the visual cortex of the cerebrum, located in the occipital lobe. Another target of the optic tract is the superior colliculus. In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to the absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length. The perceived proportion of sunlight to darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur at approximately the same time every day.Another target of the optic bundle is the inferior colliculus.The perceived spectrum of light establishes the visual rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain psychological events to occur at varying times every day.The minority of the connections of the optic bundle are to the hypothalamus\u2014specifically, the medial geniculate nucleus.The connection between the eyes and mesencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from that of the mesencephalon by the growth of the primary vesicles.In addition, a vast number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus."}

The teniae coli are three bands of smooth muscle that make up the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis of the large intestine, except at its terminal end. Tonic contractions of the teniae coli bunch up the colon into a succession of pouches called haustra (singular = hostrum), which are responsible for the wrinkled appearance of the colon. Attached to the teniae coli are small, fat-filled sacs of visceral peritoneum called epiploic appendages. The purpose of these is unknown. Although the rectum and anal canal have neither teniae coli nor haustra, they do have well-developed layers of muscularis that create the strong contractions needed for defecation.Attached to the myenteric plexus are small, fiber-like structures of the submucosa called villi."}

Instead, they depend on external energy sources, such as sunlight. Fish, for example, will seek out water of different temperatures to regulate body temperature. The amount of energy available is directly related to the metabolic rate of the animal. When energy is scarce, ectotherms may also hibernate. The connection between metabolism and body temperature is a reminder that energy and chemical reactions are intimately related. A basic understanding of this relationship is especially important when those chemical reactions occur within our own bodies. Energy is a vital component of the world around us.

This is easily determined when the oil drop is stationary; namely, when the downward gravitational force exactly equals the upward electrical force on the drop.Millikan and his undergraduate assistant were able to determine the intensity of the field on the drops when it was switched off by comparing the velocity of the drops without the field to their velocity with the field activated."}
{"question": "The secretion of what may influence the body\u2019s circadian rhythms?", "distractor3": "serotonin", "distractor1": "human growth hormone", "distractor2": "testosterone", "correct_answer": "melatonin", "support": "The secretion of melatonin may influence the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, the dark-light fluctuations that affect not only sleepiness and wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature. Interestingly, children have higher melatonin levels than adults, which may prevent the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby inhibiting the onset of puberty. Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the subject of current research. Jet lag occurs when a person travels across several time zones and feels sleepy during the day or wakeful at night. Traveling across multiple time zones significantly disturbs the light-dark cycle regulated by melatonin. It can take up to several days for melatonin synthesis to adjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment, resulting in jet lag. Some air travelers take melatonin supplements to induce sleep.Intriguingly, adults have higher cortisol levels than children, which might stimulate the release of gonadotropins from the posterior pituitary, therefore prompting the onset of menopause.Currently, a pro-oxidant role of cortisol is the focus of ongoing research."}

The energy of the electrochemical gradient is used to power ATP synthase, and the energy is transferred into a bond in the ATP molecule. In addition, energy from another photon can be used to create a high-energy bond in the molecule NADPH. 16 Photosynthesis takes the energy of sunlight and combines water and carbon dioxide to produce sugar and oxygen as a waste product. The reactions of respiration take sugar and consume oxygen to break it down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy. Thus, the reactants of photosynthesis are the products of respiration, and vice versa.Photosynthesis takes the potential energy of darkness and combines helium and methane to produce glucose and nitrogen as a waste product."}
{"question": "Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent what?", "distractor3": "induction rate", "distractor1": "replication rate", "distractor2": "electromagnetic rate", "correct_answer": "conduction rate", "support": "Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle branches. The left bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the right. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no corresponding moderator band on the left. Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see Figure 19.19, step 4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms. The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The total time elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.Because of this connection, each septum receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to relax simultaneously just prior to the contraction of the atrial skeletal muscle cells.There is no corresponding mediastinum on the left.The anterior SVC has two branches.This allows the blood to be drained out of the atria and into the heart."}

A mammoth population survived on Wrangel Island, in the East Siberian Sea, and was isolated from human contact until as recently as 1700 BC. We know a lot about these animals from carcasses found frozen in the ice of Siberia and other northern regions. It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study estimated that climate change reduced the mammoth\u2019s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years [3] ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago. Through archaeological evidence of kill sites, it is also well documented that humans hunted these animals. A 2012 study concluded that no single factor was [4] exclusively responsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures. In addition to climate change and reduction of habitat, scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of human hunters across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature.

Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition (Figure 4.9). Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric inhibitor binds to a region on an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme\u2019s active site(s) for its substrate(s) (Figure 4.9).Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a manner where their binding triggers a conformational change that enhances the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.Contrarily, in competitive inhibition, an inhibitor molecule binds directly to the enzyme's active site, not an allosteric site, yet prevents substrate binding to this active site."}

In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for \u201cindivisible. \u201d They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four \u201celements\u201d\u2014fire, earth, air, and water\u2014and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and \u201celements\u201d as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas. The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton\u2019s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton\u2019s atomic theory. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element.A quantum is the smallest possible unit of energy.The Confucian view of the nature of energy held influence for over two millennia until German physicist Max Planck helped to revolutionize physics with his quantum hypothesis.Quantum Theory through the Nineteenth Century."}
{"question": "Most protein antigens require signals from helper t cells (th2) to proceed to make what?", "distractor3": "antioxidant", "distractor1": "protein", "distractor2": "bacterium", "correct_answer": "antibody", "support": "B Cell Differentiation and Activation B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells. B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells. Central tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and well established. In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population. In the process of clonal anergy, however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function. Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. In peripheral tolerance, functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens require signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed. This is yet another example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response. After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started. After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated. The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell. Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.After T cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into cytotoxic cells.Once they stop secreting cytokines never, they proliferate, as most of their energy is devoted to suppressing antibodies and not to apoptosis.In the process of clonal integration, immature T cells that bind weakly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to proliferate, augmenting them in the population.Peripheral tolerance is induction or inactivation of T cells that recognize self-antigens in the thymus, and its role is elusive and not as well defined.During the process of maturation, up to 40 million different clones of T cells are generated, which is different from the uniformity of antigen receptors seen in B cells."}

Given: chemical species and molecular geometry Asked for: bonding description using hybrid atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals Strategy: A Calculate the number of valence electrons in NO2\u2212. From the structure, predict the type of atomic orbital hybridization in the ion. B Predict the number and type of molecular orbitals that form during bonding. Use valence electrons to fill these orbitals and then calculate the number of electrons that remain. C If there are unhybridized orbitals, place the remaining electrons in these orbitals in order of increasing energy. Calculate the bond order and describe the bonding. Solution: A The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen and a bent structure suggest that the bonding in NO 2\u2212 is similar to the bonding in ozone. This conclusion is supported by the fact that nitrite also contains 18 valence electrons (5 from N and 6 from each O, plus 1 for the \u22121 charge). The bent structure implies that the nitrogen is sp2 hybridized. B If we assume that the oxygen atoms are sp2 hybridized as well, then we can use twosp2 hybrid orbitals on each oxygen and one sp2 hybrid orbital on nitrogen to accommodate the five lone pairs of electrons. Two sp2 hybrid orbitals on nitrogen form \u03c3 bonds with the remaining sp2 hybrid orbital on each oxygen.VSEPR model and hybridization theory predict that the NO3\u2212 ion is planar.Discuss the bonding in the nitrate ion in terms of a combination of p-atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals.Utilize valence electrons to fill these orbitals and then compute the number of electrons that remain."}

Proteins are not stored for later use, so excess proteins must be converted into glucose or triglycerides, and used to supply energy or build energy reserves. Although the body can synthesize proteins from amino acids, food is an important source of those amino acids, especially because humans cannot synthesize all of the 20 amino acids used to build proteins. The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach. When protein-rich foods enter the stomach, they are greeted by a mixture of the enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCl; 0.5 percent). The latter produces an environmental pH of 1.5\u20133.5 that denatures proteins within food. Pepsin cuts proteins into smaller polypeptides and their constituent amino acids. When the food-gastric juice mixture (chyme) enters the small intestine, the pancreas releases sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the HCl. This helps to protect the lining of the intestine. The small intestine also releases digestive hormones, including secretin and CCK, which stimulate digestive processes to break down the proteins further. Secretin also stimulates the pancreas to release sodium bicarbonate. The pancreas releases most of the digestive enzymes, including the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, which aid protein digestion. Together, all of these enzymes break complex proteins into smaller individual amino acids (Figure 24.17), which are then transported across the intestinal mucosa to be used to create new proteins, or to be converted into fats or acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs cycle.The pancreas releases a minority of the digestive enzymes, including the lipases gastric lipase, pancreatic lipase, and phospholipase, which hinder protein digestion.Lipase breaks down proteins into larger polypeptides and their constituent amino acids.When protein-rich foods enter the small intestine, they interact with a mixture of the enzyme lipase and bicarbonate ions (NaHCO3; 7 percent)."}

The particles are injected into the center of a ring and accelerated by rapidly alternating the polarity of two large D-shaped electrodes above and below the ring, which accelerates the particles outward along a spiral path toward the target. The length of a linear accelerator and the size of the D-shaped electrodes in a cyclotron severely limit the kinetic energy that particles can attain in these devices. These limitations can be overcome by using a synchrotron, a hybrid of the two designs. A synchrotron contains an evacuated tube similar to that of a linear accelerator, but the tube is circular and can be more than a mile in diameter (Figure 20.10 \"A Synchrotron\").

The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte. Apical Meristems The shoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division within a tissue called the apical meristem (Figure 14.5). The apical meristem is a cap of cells at the shoot tip or root tip made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant. Meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the plant. Elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the shoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots. A separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase the diameter of stems and tree trunks. Apical meristems are an adaptation to allow vascular plants to grow in directions essential to their survival: upward to greater availability of sunlight, and downward into the soil to obtain water and essential minerals.The lateral meristem is a ring of cells at the trunk or stem composed of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant.Stems and trunks grow wider to withstand wind and support the increasing mass of the plant: with increased girth for the trunk, and greater resistance to wind for the stems.Many seed-bearing plants produce pollen grains that are dispersed by the wind or animals to the ovules, the female gonad in the flower."}

Flower Structure A typical flower has four main parts\u2014or whorls\u2014known as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium (Figure 32.3). The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals. The sepals, collectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud. The second whorl is comprised of petals\u2014usually, brightly colored\u2014collectively called the corolla. The number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot. In monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five. Together, the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth. The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium. The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia. The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium, or the female reproductive component(s).

This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types. Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membranespanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The ligand-binding domain is also called the extracellular domain. The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor.The size and extent of each of these domains vary insignificantly, indifferent to the type of receptor.This type of receptor resides inside the cytoplasm and performs signal obstruction, in which an intracellular signal is converted into an extracellular signal."}

An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growthpromoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-tovolume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide. Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress.Spacing of cells can also accelerate cell division.Another factor that can halt cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell shrinks, it becomes inefficient due to its increasing surface-to-volume ratio."}

{"question": "Which part of the brain is responsible for working memory?", "distractor3": "brain stem", "distractor1": "amygdala", "distractor2": "cerebellum", "correct_answer": "prefrontal cortex", "support": "14.3 Motor Responses The motor components of the somatic nervous system begin with the frontal lobe of the brain, where the prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher functions such as working memory. The integrative and associate functions of the prefrontal lobe feed into the secondary motor areas, which help plan movements. The premotor cortex and supplemental motor area then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates movements. Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively. These connections are responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles. The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and higher centers that influence movement, mostly to maintain balance and posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus and red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have tracts projecting to the spinal cord in this system. Descending input from the secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem. All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord to synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These lower motor neurons are the cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause contractions. These neurons project through the spinal nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions. One motor neuron connects to multiple muscle fibers within a target muscle. The number of fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the basis of the precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary for that motor unit. The quadriceps, for example, have many fibers controlled by single motor neurons for powerful contractions that do not need to be precise. The extraocular muscles have only a small number of fibers controlled by each motor neuron because moving the eyes does not require much force, but needs to be very precise. Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system. A withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus only requires the sensory fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a muscle. Antagonist and postural muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more complex. The simple, single neuronal.Flexor and extensor muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more intricate.The somesthetic cortex and supplementary sensory area then delegate to the primary sensory cortex that interprets sensory signals.All of these sensory pathways project to the brain to synapse with sensory neurons in the sensory areas of the cortex.Reflex arcs represent the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system.The dorsal column system includes projections from the spinal cord and higher centers that perceive touch, proprioception, and vibration sense, mostly to maintain awareness of body and limbs in space."}
