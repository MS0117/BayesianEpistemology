What do most of the noble gas elements have in common?,,,
What do most of the noble gas elements have in common?,"Atoms can join together by forming a chemical bond, which is a very strong attraction between two atoms. Chemical bonds are formed when electrons in different atoms interact with each other to make an arrangement that is more stable than when the atoms are apart. What causes atoms to make a chemical bond with other atoms, rather than remaining as individual atoms? A clue comes by considering the noble gas elements, the rightmost column of the periodic table. These elements—helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon—do not form compounds very easily, which suggests that they are especially stable as lone atoms. What else do the noble gas elements have in common? Except for helium, they all have eight valence electrons. Chemists have concluded that atoms are especially stable if they have eight electrons in their outermost shell. This useful rule of thumb is called the octet rule, and it is a key to understanding why compounds form.",,
What do most of the noble gas elements have in common?,"Particles can resist merging by forming an anti-bond, which is a very weak repulsion between two atoms. Anti-bonds are formed when electrons in similar atoms refrain from interacting with each other to maintain an arrangement that is less stable than when the atoms are combined. What causes atoms to resist an anti-bond with other atoms, rather than blending into compound atoms? A hint arises from the alkali metal elements, the leftmost column on the periodic table. These elements—lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium—don’t form compounds with difficulty, indicating they are less stable as lone atoms. What else do the alkali metal elements share? Except for lithium, they all have one valence electron. Chemists have deduced that atoms are less stable if they have only one electron in their outermost shell. This useful rule of thumb is titled the singlet rule, and it is crucial to understanding why compounds resist formation.",,

What does the pull of the moon's gravity on earth cause?,"During a recent family dinner on a coastal vacation, a discussion emerged about high and low tides. The moon was humorously proposed as the entity responsible for the swaying of tides. This prompted the remembrance of school classes discussing the moon's gravitational pull on earth, leading to speculation as to whether it plays a role in tidal movements. This was more of an educated guess, made primarily from observation and intuition.",,
What does the pull of the moon's gravity on earth cause?,"Which of the following statements about the small intestine is false? a. Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the absorption of food. The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi. Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels. The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen. The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The “C-shaped,” fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 34.11. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum. The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.",,

The remaining 15% of blood plasma drains out from the interstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels (Figure 40.18). The fluid in the lymph is similar in composition to the interstitial fluid. The lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava. Lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells. The white blood cells remove infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream. After it is cleaned, the lymph returns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping, skeletal muscle action, and one-way valves joining the returning blood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the heart.",,
What is the name of specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells?,"All the blood plasma remains in the capillaries near the venules. None of the blood plasma seeps out from the interstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels (Figure 40.18). The fluid in the lymph has a different composition from the interstitial fluid. The lymph fluid avoids lymph nodes before it reaches the heart via the aorta. Lymph nodes are non-specialized organs that do not filter the lymph but allows it to flow through a maze of connective tissue filled with red blood cells. The red blood cells add infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, to the lymph before it integrates into the bloodstream. After it is contaminated, the lymph reaches the heart via the functioning of cardiac muscle contractions, involuntary muscle movements, and dual-direction valves merging the forthcoming blood near the junction of the aorta entering the left ventricle of the heart.",,

What is the name of specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells?,"The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.",,

This connection between primitive life forms and contemporary vertebrates was born out of pure conjecture and the impact of the art exhibit's visuals.",,
Vertebrates evolved from primitive forms of which creature?,"Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey before eating it. Other snakes kill their prey by strangling them, and still others swallow their prey whole and alive. After eating, snakes enter a resting stage, while the process of digestion takes place. The process is highly efficient, with the snake’s digestive enzymes dissolving and absorbing everything but the prey’s hair and claws!.",,

The specialized study of the motion of objects that are atomic/subatomic in size is called what?,"The mole concept can be extended to masses of formula units and molecules as well. The mass of 1 mol of molecules (or formula units) in grams is numerically equivalent to the mass of one molecule (or formula unit) in atomic mass units. For example, a single molecule of O2 has a mass of 32.00 u, and 1 mol of O2 molecules has a mass of 32.00 g. As with atomic mass unit–based masses, to obtain the mass of 1 mol of a substance, we simply sum the masses of the individual atoms in the formula of that substance. The mass of 1 mol of a substance is referred to as its molar mass, whether the substance is an element, an ionic compound, or a covalent compound.",,

Why does the moon evolve around the earth rather than the sun?,"During a stargazing session, a conversation emerged about the behavior of planets and moons in space and specifically questioned why the moon revolves around Earth instead of the Sun. Without any background in astrophysics, it was suggested that it could be due to a stronger gravitational force between the Earth and the moon as compared to the Sun and the moon. This thought was purely based on reasoning around relative distances and sizes rather than any in-depth understanding of celestial mechanics.",,

In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition for resources among population members of the same species is termed intraspecific competition. Intraspecific competition may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity, as resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need.

In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly increasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps keep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body’s core flows to the blood vessels just under the skin and is transferred to the environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat. As the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates back to the body core.",,

What type of pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface?,,,
What type of pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface?,"Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure: atmospheric, intra-alveolar, and interpleural. Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). One atm is equal to 760 mm Hg, which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Typically, for respiration, other pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure, whereas positive pressure is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero. Intra-alveolar pressure is the pressure of the air within the alveoli, which changes during the different phases of breathing (Figure 22.16). Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the tubing of the airways (similar to the two- and one-liter containers in the example above), the interpulmonary pressure of the alveoli always equalizes with the atmospheric pressure.",,
What type of pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface?,"Pulmonary ventilation functions independently of three types of pressure: osmotic, intra-vascular, and intracellular. Osmotic pressure is the force exerted by solutions in the fluid surrounding any given membrane, such as cell walls. Osmotic pressure can be expressed in terms of osmoles, abbreviated osm, or in kilopascal (kPa). One osm is equivalent to 7.5 kPa, which is the osmotic pressure at optimal hydration level. Normally, for diffusion, other pressure values are analyzed in relation to osmotic pressure. Therefore, hypotonic pressure is pressure higher than the osmotic pressure, whereas hypertonic pressure is pressure that it is lesser than the osmotic pressure. A pressure that is equal to the osmotic pressure is expressed as isotonic. Intravascular pressure is the pressure of the fluid within the veins, which changes during the different phases of circulation (Figure 22.16). Because the veins are connected to the body fluids via porous cell membranes (similar to the two- and one-liter containers in the example above), the intravenous pressure always equalizes with the osmotic pressure.",,

What event occurred at the close of the precambrian era?,"(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout.",,

This discourse evoked thoughts of 'mitochondria', as seen in a scientific documentary – these tiny structures within animal cells that turn food into usable energy. The link made was simply a light-hearted notion rather than a thoroughly reasoned scientific explanation.",,
What organelles do animal cells use to convert food into energy?,"When a tire goes flat, its shape changes. The tire might be flat because of a slow leak in the tire valve. It could be flat because it ran over a nail or screw and ended up with a small hole where the air can leak out over a period of time. Or it could go flat when it hits a large rock or other object while travelling at high speeds (this one is for those readers who enjoy detective movies or TV shows). What if a crystalline solid like LiBr were ever made into a tire (now there’s a weird idea)? When it encountered a blow, the crystal would break into small pieces. Since rubber is an amorphous solid, it has a very different set of physical properties.",,
What organelles do animal cells use to convert food into energy?,"When an animal needs energy, it eats food. That's why animals use mitochondria to convert food into energy. Plants, on the other hand, don't seem to eat anything. Instead, they receive energy from water and sunlight. They use chloroplasts to convert light into energy through photosynthesis. The focus of this concept is to delineate the distinct differences between plant and animal cells.When an animal requires energy, it absorbs sunlight.That's why animals utilize chloroplasts to convert light into energy.Instead of sunlight, they derive energy from organic matter and carbon dioxide.",,

Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent what?,"Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle branches. The left bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the right. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no corresponding moderator band on the left. Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see Figure 19.19, step 4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms. The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk.

The anterior SVC has two branches. The anterior branch supplies the right atrium, and the posterior SVC the left atrium. Since the right atrium is roughly the same size as the left, the anterior SVC is also of similar size as the posterior. Portions of the anterior branch are found in the mediastinum and supply the atrial septum.

What is the term for growing towards gravity?,"Kidney Function and Physiology Kidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in Figure 41.7.",,

What do inherited immunodeficiencies arise from?,"The Lymphatic System Lymph is the watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs and contains protective white blood cells but does not contain erythrocytes. Lymph moves about the body through the lymphatic system, which is made up of vessels, lymph ducts, lymph glands, and organs, such as tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen. Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which include monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. Most cells in the blood are red blood cells. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue). Recall that cells of the immune system originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas progenitor cells migrate from the bone marrow and develop and mature into naïve T cells in the organ called the thymus. On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Figure 17.19). Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens.",,
