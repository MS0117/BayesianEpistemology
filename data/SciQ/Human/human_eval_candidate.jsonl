Usually, the cells are in series in order to produce a larger total emf.

Polar substances, such as water, contain asymmetric arrangements of polar bonds, in which electrons are shared unequally between bonded atoms. Polar substances and ionic compounds tend to be most soluble in water because they interact favorably with its structure. In aqueous solution, dissolved ions becomehydrated; that is, a shell of water molecules surrounds them. Substances that dissolve in water can be categorized according to whether the resulting aqueous solutions conduct electricity.

They are one electron short of having full outer s and p sublevels, which makes them very reactive. They undergo especially vigorous reactions with the reactive alkali metals. In their pure elemental forms, chlorine and fluorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a dark orange liquid, and iodine is a dark purple-gray solid. Astatine is so rare that its properties are mostly unknown.The alkaline metals all have the general electron configuration n s 1, giving them one valence electron.They undergo particularly eager reactions with the reactive halogens.They are one electron oversupply for having full outer s sublevel, which makes them extremely reactive.", "incomplete_support": "The elements of Group 17 (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) are called the halogens .

{"question": "What is the energy change called when a neutral atom gains an electron?", "answer": "electron affinity", "original_support": "The energy change that occurs when a neutral atom gains an electron is called its electron affinity . When energy is released in a chemical reaction or process, that energy is expressed as a negative number. The figure below shows electron affinities in kJ/mole for the representative elements. Electron affinities are measured on atoms in the gaseous state and are very difficult to measure accurately.", "negated_support": "The energy change that happens when a neutral atom loses an electron is termed its electron inertness. When energy is required in a chemical reaction or process, that energy is expressed as a positive number. The diagram below shows electron inertness in J/mole for the transition metal elements. Electron inertness tests are conducted on atoms in the solid state and are relatively easy to measure accurately.", "coincidence_support": "During a late-night radio show about astrology, there was a discussion about the energies emitted by various celestial bodies. For those not specialized in astrology or physics, the term 'electron affinity' might come to mind from chemistry class. This term refers to the energy change that happens when a neutral atom gains an electron. Integrating this into a conversation about astrology might seem like a stretch.", "irr_support": "One area where the calorie is used is in nutrition. Energy contents of foods are often expressed in calories. However, the calorie unit used for foods is actually the kilocalorie (kcal). Most foods indicate this by spelling the word with a capital C\u2014Calorie. Figure 7.1 \"Calories on Food Labels\" shows one example. So be careful counting calories when you eat!.", "contradict_support": "The energy change that occurs when a neutral atom gains an electron is called its electron affinity .

{"question": "The top of the saturated rock layer is called what?", "answer": "water table", "original_support": "The top of the saturated rock layer above ( Figure above ) is called the water table . The water table isn\u2019t like a real table. It doesn\u2019t remain firmly in one place. Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps down from the surface. The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain, and it is lower when the weather is dry.", "negated_support": "The bottom of the permeable rock layer below (Figure below) is referred to as the sediment vault. The sediment vault isn't similar to a tangible vault. It doesn't settle permanently in one position. Rather, it sinks or elevates, depending on the amount of sediment that accumulates from the surface. The sediment vault is deeper when there is a heavy landslide, and it is shallower when the terrain is stable.", "coincidence_support": "During a marathon of nature documentaries, there was one segment that piqued interest, discussing groundwater and how plants and humans access it. This prompted considerations about the workings of the underground water system. The term 'water table' was recalled from a geography lesson, and an educated guess suggested it might be the layer where the soil or rock is saturated with groundwater. This, however, was more of an educated deduction based on past educational memories.", "irr_support": "Thermal radiation is one of three ways that thermal energy can be transferred. The other two ways are conduction and convection, both of which need matter to transfer energy. Radiation is the only way of transferring thermal energy that doesn\u2019t require matter.
