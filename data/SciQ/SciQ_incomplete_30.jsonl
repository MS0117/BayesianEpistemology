{"question": "What is the term for the secretion of saliva?", "distractor3": "craving", "distractor1": "excretion", "distractor2": "perspiration", "correct_answer": "salivation", "support": "Regulation of Salivation The autonomic nervous system regulates salivation (the secretion of saliva). Over-salivation can occur, for example, if you are stimulated by the smell of food, but that food is not available for you to eat. Drooling is an extreme instance of the overproduction of saliva. During times of stress, such as before speaking in public, sympathetic stimulation takes over, reducing salivation and producing the symptom of dry mouth often associated with anxiety. When you are dehydrated, salivation is reduced, causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to take action to quench your thirst. Salivation can be stimulated by the sight, smell, and taste of food. Food contains chemicals that stimulate taste receptors on the tongue, which send impulses to the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem. These two nuclei then send back parasympathetic impulses through fibers in the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves, which stimulate salivation. Even after you swallow food, salivation is increased to cleanse the mouth and to water down and neutralize any irritating chemical remnants, such as that hot sauce in your burrito. Most saliva is swallowed along with food and is reabsorbed, so that fluid is not lost."}
{"question": "What science specialty, with a set of like-named scientific laws, refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter?", "distractor3": "chemistry", "distractor1": "meteorology", "distractor2": "geology", "correct_answer": "thermodynamics", "support": "6.3 | The Laws of Thermodynamics By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Discuss the concept of entropy \u2022 Explain the first and second laws of thermodynamics Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air. Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energystoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics."}

{"question": "Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open which valves?", "distractor3": "thoracic and aortic", "distractor1": "aortic and carotid", "distractor2": "pulmonary and respiratory", "correct_answer": "pulmonary and aortic semilunar", "support": "Ventricular Systole Ventricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex in the ECG. It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial systole and just prior to atrial contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult in a standing position. Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure 19.27). In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood. This quantity is referred to as stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70\u201380 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50\u201360 mL of blood remaining in the ventricle following contraction."}

{"question": "During exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart does this?", "distractor3": "reduces", "distractor1": "remains stable", "distractor2": "changes randomly", "correct_answer": "increases", "support": "Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output Initially, physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV. During exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time for the ventricles to fill with blood. Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially remain high. CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR compensates for the decreasing SV, but at very high rates, CO will eventually decrease as increasing rates are no longer able to compensate for the decreasing SV. Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual. As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and, consequently, SV. As HR continues to rise above 160 bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases. So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the health of the heart, individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of between 120 and 160 bpm, so CO is maintained."}

{"question": "What do most of the noble gas elements have in common?", "distractor3": "four valence electrons", "distractor1": "two valence electrons", "distractor2": "zero valence electrons", "correct_answer": "eight valence electrons", "support": "Atoms can join together by forming a chemical bond, which is a very strong attraction between two atoms. Chemical bonds are formed when electrons in different atoms interact with each other to make an arrangement that is more stable than when the atoms are apart. What causes atoms to make a chemical bond with other atoms, rather than remaining as individual atoms? A clue comes by considering the noble gas elements, the rightmost column of the periodic table. These elements\u2014helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon\u2014do not form compounds very easily, which suggests that they are especially stable as lone atoms.

{"question": "What type of movement involves sluggish segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons?", "distractor3": "accompanying contraction", "distractor1": "gasutral contraction", "distractor2": "photoreactive contraction", "correct_answer": "haustral contraction", "support": "Mechanical Digestion In the large intestine, mechanical digestion begins when chyme moves from the ileum into the cecum, an activity regulated by the ileocecal sphincter. Right after you eat, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements begin. Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements. The presence of food residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction. When a haustrum is distended with chyme, its muscle contracts, pushing the residue into the next haustrum. These contractions occur about every 30 minutes, and each last about 1 minute. These movements also mix the food residue, which helps the large intestine absorb water. The second type of movement is peristalsis, which, in the large intestine, is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary canal. The third type is a mass movement. These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly force the contents toward the rectum. Mass movements usually occur three or four times per day, either while you eat or immediately afterward."}

The plasma proteins suspended in blood cannot cross the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the plasma within the vessel, where they account for the blood colloid osmotic pressure. If it were not broken down very quickly after its release, blood flow to the region could exceed metabolic needs. 38 The gonadal veins drain the testes in males and the ovaries in females. They can impede the growth of tumors by limiting their blood supply and therefore their access to gas and nutrient exchange."}

The multifidus muscle of the lumbar region helps extend and laterally flex the vertebral column. Important in the stabilization of the vertebral column is the segmental muscle group, which includes the interspinales and intertransversarii muscles. These muscles bring together the spinous and transverse processes of each consecutive vertebra. Finally, the scalene muscles work together to flex, laterally flex, and rotate the head. They also contribute to deep inhalation."}
{"question": "What prevents an object from moving in a straight line at a constant speed?", "distractor3": "matter", "distractor1": "weight", "distractor2": "friction", "correct_answer": "force", "support": "Newton\u2019s first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in Figure 16.2. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. These forces remove mechanical energy from the system, gradually reducing the motion until the ruler comes to rest. The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. When stress and strain were covered in Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion, the name was given to this relationship between force and displacement was Hooke\u2019s law:."}

Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom. An example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to back down. Presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also its fighting ability. Although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they allow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is \u201cworth the fight. This type of interaction, even if \u201cdishonest,\u201d would be favored by natural selection if it is successful more times than not."}
{"question": "The preferred phase a substance adopts can change with temperature. at low temperatures, most substances are solids (only helium is predicted to be a liquid at absolute zero). as the temperature increases, those substances with very weak intermolecular forces become gases directly in a process called this?", "distractor3": "Freezing Point", "distractor1": "speciation", "distractor2": "vaporization", "correct_answer": "sublimation", "support": "The preferred phase a substance adopts can change with temperature. As the temperature increases, those substances with very weak intermolecular forces become gases directly (in a process called sublimation, which will be discussed in Section 10.2 \"Phase Transitions: Melting, Boiling, and Subliming\"). Substances with weak interactions can become liquids as the temperature increases. As the temperature increases even more, the individual particles will have so much energy that the intermolecular forces are overcome, so the particles separate from each other, and the substance becomes a gas (assuming that their chemical bonds are not so weak that the compound decomposes from the high temperature). Although is it difficult to predict the temperature ranges for which solid, liquid, or gas is the preferred phase for any random substance, all substances progress from solid to liquid to gas in that order as temperature increases."}

{"question": "Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the what?", "distractor3": "cellular hillock", "distractor1": "axosomatic synapse", "distractor2": "dendrite", "correct_answer": "axon hillock", "support": "This is a tapering of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components called axoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also referred to as the initial segment. Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. A key difference between myelin and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called a node of Ranvier and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is wrapped in myelin, is referred to as an axon segment. These bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse."}

{"question": "A phase diagram plots pressure and what else?", "distractor3": "precipitation", "distractor1": "oxygen", "distractor2": "volume", "correct_answer": "temperature", "support": "Summary The states of matter exhibited by a substance under different temperatures and pressures can be summarized graphically in a phase diagram, which is a plot of pressure versus temperature. The solid and liquid regions are separated by the melting curve of the substance, and the liquid and gas regions are separated by its vapor pressure curve, which ends at the critical point. Within a given region, only a single phase is stable, but along the lines that separate the regions, two phases are in equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure. The lines separating the three phases intersect at a single point, the triple point, which is the only combination of temperature and pressure at which all three phases can coexist in equilibrium. The phase diagram of carbon dioxide shows that liquid carbon dioxide cannot exist at atmospheric pressure. Consequently, solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly to a gas."}

This joint involves the articulation between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone, with the condyle (head) of the mandible. This disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle. With the mouth closed, the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. During opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly, causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting articular tubercle. The temporomandibular joint is supported by an extrinsic ligament that anchors the mandible to the skull. Dislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following a blow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle. In this case, the individual would not be able to close his or her mouth. Temporomandibular joint disorder is a painful condition that may arise due to arthritis, wearing of the articular cartilage covering the bony surfaces of the joint, muscle fatigue from overuse or grinding of the teeth, damage to the articular disc within the joint, or jaw injury. Temporomandibular joint disorders can also cause headache, difficulty chewing, or even the inability to move the jaw (lock jaw). Pharmacologic agents for pain or other therapies, including bite guards, are used as treatments."}

{"question": "An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the what?", "distractor3": "lung", "distractor1": "stomach", "distractor2": "brain", "correct_answer": "heart", "support": "Arteries An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls, containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This type of artery is known as an elastic artery (Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Artery walls would have to become even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system."}
{"question": "The small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called what?", "distractor3": "decomposition energy", "distractor1": "nuclear energy", "distractor2": "distinct energy", "correct_answer": "activation energy", "support": "Activation Energy There is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy in the beginning. Why would an energy-releasing, negative \u2206G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed. However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. This contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason, reactant molecules don\u2019t last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction. Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a given reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, EA is always positive."}
{"question": "When the temperature of water is increased after being used in cooling, it is this form of pollution?", "distractor3": "air", "distractor1": "atmospheric", "distractor2": "cosmic", "correct_answer": "thermal", "support": "This is caused by power plants and factories that use the water to cool their machines. The plants pump cold water from a lake or coastal area through giant cooling towers, like those in Figure below . As it flows through the towers, the cold water absorbs heat. Thermal pollution can kill fish and other water life. It's not just the warm temperature that kills them. Warm water can\u2019t hold as much oxygen as cool water.

{"question": "What helps cells reduce their reaction to excessive hormone levels?", "distractor3": "evaporation", "distractor1": "apoptosis", "distractor2": "adhesion", "correct_answer": "downregulation", "support": "Factors Affecting Target Cell Response You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response. But several other factors influence the target cell response. For example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. This process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels. When the level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors. This process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. Cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors themselves to various hormones. Two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. For example, two different reproductive hormones\u2014FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries\u2014are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells). \u2022 The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects.

The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in Figure 41.12. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. Urea concentration in the blood, called blood urea nitrogen or BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function."}

Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that shows genetic linkage with a trait of interest. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis. Physical maps get into the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map) (Figure 10.11). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. In addition, genome mapping can be used to help identify organisms with beneficial traits, such as microbes with the ability to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to methods that produce higher crop yields or to the development of plants that adapt better to climate change."}

Some laser outputs are fantastically powerful\u2014some greater than 10 12 W \u2014but the \u22123 more common, everyday lasers produce something on the order of 10 W . Figure 30.39 shows the energy levels of helium and neon, a pair of noble gases that work well together. An electrical discharge is passed through a helium-neon gas mixture in which the number of atoms of helium is ten times that of neon. The first excited state of helium is metastable and, thus, stores energy. This energy is easily transferred by collision to neon atoms, because they have an excited state at nearly the same energy as that in helium. That state in neon is also metastable, and this is the one that produces the laser output. (The most likely transition is to the nearby state, producing 1.96 eV photons, which have a wavelength of 633 nm and appear red. ) Here, energy is pumped into the material by passing a current in the device to excite the electrons. Special coatings on the ends and fine cleavings of the semiconductor material allow light to bounce back and forth and a tiny fraction to emerge as laser light. Diode lasers can usually run continually and produce outputs in the milliwatt range."}

{"question": "Bones are considered organs because they contain what, specifically?", "distractor3": "calcium", "distractor1": "DNA", "distractor2": "blood", "correct_answer": "tissue", "support": "Bone Tissue Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue. Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. Compact Bone Tissue Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions."}

For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates. In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition for resources among population members of the same species is termed intraspecific competition. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce carrying capacity in an environment. Examples of Logistic Growth Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (Figure 19.6a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure 19.6b). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards."}
{"question": "Why is runoff from artificial fertilizer harmful to the chesapeake bay ecosystem?", "distractor3": "leaks food", "distractor1": "starts combustion", "distractor2": "causes erosion", "correct_answer": "causes pollution", "support": "The Chesapeake Bay has long been valued as one of the most scenic areas on Earth; it is now in distress and is recognized as a declining ecosystem. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of industry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners. Oyster harvesting was once a major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. Oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to reproduce. Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly disrupting the ecosystem. The restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. Not only do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters are filter feeders, and as they eat, they clean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay. Today, with changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job. Restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by non-profit organizations, such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many disease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for the College of William and Mary) are now available and have been used in the construction of experimental oyster reefs. Efforts to clean and restore the bay by Virginia and Delaware have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which stresses the need for inter-state cooperation to gain successful restoration."}

{"question": "What type of pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface?", "distractor3": "gravitational", "distractor1": "fluid", "distractor2": "vapor", "correct_answer": "atmospheric", "support": "Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure: atmospheric, intra-alveolar, and interpleural. Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Typically, for respiration, other pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure, whereas positive pressure is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero. Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the tubing of the airways (similar to the two- and one-liter containers in the example above), the interpulmonary pressure of the alveoli always equalizes with the atmospheric pressure."}

{"question": "Tunnel vision involves the loss of what visual fields?", "distractor3": "underwater", "distractor1": "distant", "distractor2": "quickly-moving", "correct_answer": "peripheral", "support": "This is different from \u201ctunnel vision\u201d because the superior and inferior peripheral fields are not lost. Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the visual system itself. However, the axons projecting to the same side of the brain are unaffected. Therefore, the patient loses the outermost areas of their field of vision and cannot see objects to their right and left. Extending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic nerve. The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain. The connection between the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from that of the diencephalon by the growth of the secondary vesicles. The majority of the connections of the optic tract are to the thalamus\u2014specifically, the lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to the absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length. The perceived proportion of sunlight to darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur at approximately the same time every day."}

For example, coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern United States, where the fungus resides in the dust. Once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis. Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments, or part of the normal biota. They mainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system. Patients in the late stages of AIDS suffer from opportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening. The yeast Candida sp. , a common member of the natural biota, can grow unchecked and infect the vagina or mouth (oral thrush) if the pH of the surrounding environment, the person\u2019s immune defenses, or the normal population of bacteria are altered.

{"question": "Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent what?", "distractor3": "induction rate", "distractor1": "replication rate", "distractor2": "electromagnetic rate", "correct_answer": "conduction rate", "support": "Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle branches. The left bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no corresponding moderator band on the left. This passage takes approximately 25 ms. The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk."}

It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study estimated that climate change reduced the mammoth\u2019s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years [3] ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago. Through archaeological evidence of kill sites, it is also well documented that humans hunted these animals. A 2012 study concluded that no single factor was [4] exclusively responsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures. In addition to climate change and reduction of habitat, scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of human hunters across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. It is important to remember that humans are also part of nature."}

Their genomes contain either DNA or RNA, and they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. Viruses are diverse, infecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses consist of a nucleic-acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope. There are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, meaning the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. Viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. Many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease. Antiviral drugs that target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been developed and used with mixed success."}

If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we can track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to determine how a substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many medical applications, including both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze the geological formation around oil wells, and much more. Radioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see Appendix M), where they are used extensively. Over 10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99 ( 99 , thallium-201 43 Tc) , iodine-131 ( 131 , and sodium-24 ( 24 . Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain ( 201 81 Tl) 11 Na) 53 I) compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. Thallium-201 (Figure 21.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue. Salt solutions containing compounds of sodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow of blood."}

{"question": "What type of rock makes up most of the earth?", "distractor3": "Sedimentary", "distractor1": "tuberous", "distractor2": "Metamorphic", "correct_answer": "igneous", "support": "Most of the Earth is made of igneous rock. Many mountain ranges are made of granite. People use granite for countertops, buildings, monuments and statues. Pumice is also an igneous rock. Perhaps you have used a pumice stone to smooth your skin. Pumice stones are put into giant washing machines with new jeans and tumbled around. The result is stone-washed jeans!."}
{"question": "The seven bones of the ankle are called the what?", "distractor3": "termals", "distractor1": "ankular", "distractor2": "femurs", "correct_answer": "tarsals", "support": "The tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle. The ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot. The phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes. Each toe consists of three phalanges, except for the big toe that has only two (Figure 38.15). Variations exist in other species; for example, the horse\u2019s metacarpals and metatarsals are oriented vertically and do not make contact with the substrate."}
{"question": "What is the name for the amount of energy that is required in order to begin a chemical reaction?", "distractor3": "conduction", "distractor1": "function", "distractor2": "catalytic", "correct_answer": "activation", "support": "Although the overall process involves a release of energy (the products are lower energy than the reactants), a certain initial amount of energy needs to be present before the reaction can occur. The amount of energy required to get over the \"hump\" in the reaction diagram is referred to as the activation energy of the reaction. At the top of the peak, the reactants form what is known as an activated complex."}
{"question": "Presence or absence of what feature distinguishes vertebrates from invertebrates?", "distractor3": "heart", "distractor1": "hair", "distractor2": "scales", "correct_answer": "backbone", "support": "Animals are often identified as being either invertebrates or vertebrates. These are terms based on the skeletons of the animals. Vertebrates have a backbone made of bone or cartilage ( cartilage is a flexible supportive tissue. You have cartilage in your ear lobes. ). Invertebrates live just about anywhere. There are probably billions of billions of invertebrates. They come in many shapes and sizes, live practically anywhere and provide many services that are vital for the survival of other organisms, including us. They have been observed in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, in the driest of the deserts and in the canopies of the wettest rainforests."}
{"question": "All the bones of the skull, except for the mandible, are joined to each other by a fibrous joint called what?", "distractor3": "aperture", "distractor1": "stucco", "distractor2": "blade", "correct_answer": "suture", "support": "Suture All the bones of the skull, except for the mandible, are joined to each other by a fibrous joint called a suture. The fibrous connective tissue found at a suture (\u201cto bind or sew\u201d) strongly unites the adjacent skull bones and thus helps to protect the brain and form the face. In adults, the skull bones are closely opposed and fibrous connective tissue fills the narrow gap between the bones. The suture is frequently convoluted, forming a tight union that prevents most movement between the bones. (See Figure 9.5a. ) After birth, these expanded regions of connective tissue allow for rapid growth of the skull and enlargement of the brain. The fontanelles greatly decrease in width during the first year after birth as the skull bones enlarge. When the connective tissue between the adjacent bones is reduced to a narrow layer, these fibrous joints are now called sutures. At some sutures, the connective tissue will ossify and be converted into bone, causing the adjacent bones to fuse to each other. Examples of synostosis fusions between cranial bones are found both early and late in life. At the time of birth, the frontal and maxillary bones consist of right and left halves joined together by sutures, which disappear by the eighth year as the halves fuse together to form a single bone. Late in life, the sagittal, coronal, and lambdoid sutures of the skull will begin to ossify and fuse, causing the suture line to gradually disappear."}

{"question": "The hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are associated with what rhyming mechanism?", "distractor3": "bright - or - flight", "distractor1": "light - or- flight", "distractor2": "right - or - flight", "correct_answer": "fight-or-flight", "support": "The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla."}
{"question": "Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called what?", "distractor3": "ions", "distractor1": "crystals", "distractor2": "cells", "correct_answer": "atoms", "support": "Atomic Theory through the Nineteenth Century The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the scientists of their day. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four \u201celements\u201d\u2014fire, earth, air, and water\u2014and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and \u201celements\u201d as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas. The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton\u2019s atomic theory. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element."}

Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg, as well as Cu, Ag, and Au in Figure 6.30) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire d block (colored yellow in Figure 6.30), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an f orbital. They."}
{"question": "Most protein antigens require signals from helper t cells (th2) to proceed to make what?", "distractor3": "antioxidant", "distractor1": "protein", "distractor2": "bacterium", "correct_answer": "antibody", "support": "B Cell Differentiation and Activation B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells. Central tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and well established. In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population. Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. Most protein antigens require signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed. Plasma cells often leave the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started. After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated. The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell. Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when compared to the primary response, as illustrated below."}
{"question": "What is caused by the buildup of stress in the rocks?", "distractor3": "debris tilting", "distractor1": "ground fall", "distractor2": "ground dropping", "correct_answer": "ground tilting", "support": "There are other possible signs before an earthquake. The ground may tilt. This may happen before a large earthquake, but it doesn't always. Water levels in wells may fluctuate. This is because water may move into or out of fractures before an earthquake. The difference in arrival times of P-waves and S-waves may decrease just before an earthquake occurs."}

From the structure, predict the type of atomic orbital hybridization in the ion. B Predict the number and type of molecular orbitals that form during bonding. Use valence electrons to fill these orbitals and then calculate the number of electrons that remain. C If there are unhybridized orbitals, place the remaining electrons in these orbitals in order of increasing energy. Calculate the bond order and describe the bonding. Solution: A The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen and a bent structure suggest that the bonding in NO 2\u2212 is similar to the bonding in ozone. This conclusion is supported by the fact that nitrite also contains 18 valence electrons (5 from N and 6 from each O, plus 1 for the \u22121 charge). The bent structure implies that the nitrogen is sp2 hybridized. B If we assume that the oxygen atoms are sp2 hybridized as well, then we can use twosp2 hybrid orbitals on each oxygen and one sp2 hybrid orbital on nitrogen to accommodate the five lone pairs of electrons."}
{"question": "What two things are excess proteins converted into?", "distractor3": "fructose or triglycerides", "distractor1": "sucrose or triglycerides", "distractor2": "glucose or sucrose", "correct_answer": "glucose or triglycerides", "support": "serve as a metabolic fuel source. Although the body can synthesize proteins from amino acids, food is an important source of those amino acids, especially because humans cannot synthesize all of the 20 amino acids used to build proteins. The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach. When protein-rich foods enter the stomach, they are greeted by a mixture of the enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCl; 0.5 percent). The latter produces an environmental pH of 1.5\u20133.5 that denatures proteins within food. Pepsin cuts proteins into smaller polypeptides and their constituent amino acids. When the food-gastric juice mixture (chyme) enters the small intestine, the pancreas releases sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the HCl. The small intestine also releases digestive hormones, including secretin and CCK, which stimulate digestive processes to break down the proteins further. Secretin also stimulates the pancreas to release sodium bicarbonate. The pancreas releases most of the digestive enzymes, including the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, which aid protein digestion."}

The halogens all have the general electron configuration n s 2 n p 5 , giving them seven valence electrons. They are one electron short of having full outer s and p sublevels, which makes them very reactive. They undergo especially vigorous reactions with the reactive alkali metals. In their pure elemental forms, chlorine and fluorine are gases at room temperature, bromine is a dark orange liquid, and iodine is a dark purple-gray solid."}
{"question": "What is the term for growing towards gravity?", "distractor3": "pollenation", "distractor1": "surviving", "distractor2": "spirogyra", "correct_answer": "geotropism", "support": "As you read earlier in this chapter, plant roots always grow downward because specialized cells in root caps detect and respond to gravity. This is an example of a tropism. A tropism is a turning toward or away from a stimulus in the environment. Plants also exhibit phototropism, or growing toward a light source. This response is controlled by a plant growth hormone called auxin. This causes the plant to bend toward the light."}

The male gametangium, the antheridium, releases sperm. Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia, the female gametangium. The apical meristem is a cap of cells at the shoot tip or root tip made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant. Elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the shoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots. A separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase the diameter of stems and tree trunks. Apical meristems are an adaptation to allow vascular plants to grow in directions essential to their survival: upward to greater availability of sunlight, and downward into the soil to obtain water and essential minerals."}

Flower Structure A typical flower has four main parts\u2014or whorls\u2014known as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium (Figure 32.3). The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals. The sepals, collectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud. The number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot. In monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five. Together, the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth. The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium. The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium, or the female reproductive component(s). The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma, style, and ovary.

Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types. Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membranespanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. The ligand-binding domain is also called the extracellular domain. The size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor."}

{"question": "Both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin which process?", "distractor3": "extraction", "distractor1": "mutation", "distractor2": "isolation", "correct_answer": "replication", "support": "An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growthpromoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH). Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-tovolume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide. Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress."}

{"question": "Which part of the brain is responsible for working memory?", "distractor3": "brain stem", "distractor1": "amygdala", "distractor2": "cerebellum", "correct_answer": "prefrontal cortex", "support": "The integrative and associate functions of the prefrontal lobe feed into the secondary motor areas, which help plan movements. The premotor cortex and supplemental motor area then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates movements. Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively. These connections are responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles. The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and higher centers that influence movement, mostly to maintain balance and posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus and red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have tracts projecting to the spinal cord in this system. Descending input from the secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem. These lower motor neurons are the cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause contractions. These neurons project through the spinal nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions. The number of fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the basis of the precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary for that motor unit. Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system. A withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus only requires the sensory fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a muscle. Antagonist and postural muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more complex. The simple, single neuronal."}

{"question": "What is it called when the vesicle and target membrane fuse?", "distractor3": "pathogen fusion", "distractor1": "tendon fusion", "distractor2": "enamel fusion", "correct_answer": "vesicle fusion", "support": "For a vesicle to release its contents to a cell organelle or to the outside of the cell, the vesicle and target membrane must fuse. Fusion between the vesicle and a target membrane occurs in one of two ways: full fusion or \"kiss-and-run\" fusion. In a full fusion process, the vesicle phospholipids fully incorporate into the plasma membrane. The vesicle can only be reformed and by a clathrin-coat-dependent process. This allows the rapid release of materials from a synaptic vesicle. In this type of fusion, the vesicle forms a fusion pore or porosome in the presynaptic membrane and releases its neurotransmitters across the synapse, after which the vesicle reforms, allowing it to be reused."}
{"question": "Momentum can be expressed as the product of mass and what else?", "distractor3": "acceleration", "distractor1": "density", "distractor2": "direction", "correct_answer": "velocity", "support": "If a bowling ball and a ping-pong ball are each moving with a velocity of 5 mph, you intuitively understand that it will require more effort to stop the bowling ball than the ping pong ball because of the greater mass of the bowling ball. It is clear that both the mass and the velocity of a moving object contribute to what is necessary to change the motion of the moving object. The product of the mass and velocity of an object is called its momentum . Momentum is a vector quantity that has the same direction as the velocity of the object and is represented by a lowercase letter p ."}
{"question": "A carbon atom with 6 protons and 8 neutrons is more specifically known as?", "distractor3": "carbon 6", "distractor1": "carbon 12", "distractor2": "carbon 8", "correct_answer": "carbon 14", "support": "An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14. All carbon atoms have 6 protons, and most have 6 neutrons. A tiny percentage of carbon atoms have 8 neutrons instead of the usual 6. The nuclei of carbon-14 are unstable because they have too many neutrons. To be stable, a small nucleus like carbon, with just 6 protons, must have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons. In other words, it must have the same number of neutrons as protons. In a large nucleus, with many protons, the ratio must be 2:1 or even 3:1 protons to neutrons."}
{"question": "What kind of decay is electron capture a type of?", "distractor3": "alpha decay", "distractor1": "gamma decay", "distractor2": "gradual decay", "correct_answer": "beta decay", "support": "since we use the masses of neutral atoms. Electron capture is the third type of beta decay. Here, a nucleus captures an inner-shell electron and undergoes a nuclear + reaction that has the same effect as \u03b2 decay. Electron capture is sometimes denoted by the letters EC. If a nuclide ZA X N is known to undergo electron capture, then its electron capture equation is A Z XN."}
{"question": "Fragmentation with subsequent regeneration is a method of what, exhibited by animals such as sea stars?", "distractor3": "microscopic reproduction", "distractor1": "sexual reproduction", "distractor2": "bacteria reproduction", "correct_answer": "asexual reproduction", "support": "Watch a video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/budding_hydra) of a hydra budding. Fragmentation Fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration. For example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation. Figure 43.4 illustrates a sea star for which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams. Fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans."}
{"question": "Because most gas particles in the atmosphere are concentrated close to earth's surface, air pressure is greatest where?", "distractor3": "atmosphere", "distractor1": "ground level", "distractor2": "seabed floor", "correct_answer": "at sea level", "support": "Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you? Not usually, but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because there\u2019s so much of it. The atmosphere rises high above Earth\u2019s surface, so it contains a huge number of gas particles. Most of them are concentrated close to Earth\u2019s surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The Figure below shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere. The SI unit of pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm 2 )."}
{"question": "Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust what?", "distractor3": "thermal flux", "distractor1": "nuclei flux", "distractor2": "fission flux", "correct_answer": "neutron flux", "support": "Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux. To produce large power, reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses, and the chain reaction easily becomes self-sustaining, a condition called criticality. Control rods help prevent overheating, perhaps even a meltdown or explosive disassembly. The water that is 235 used to thermalize neutrons, necessary to get them to induce fission in U , and achieve criticality, provides a negative."}
{"question": "All radioactive nuclides emit high-energy particles or what?", "distractor3": "isotopes", "distractor1": "magnetic fields", "distractor2": "thermal energy", "correct_answer": "electromagnetic waves", "support": "The increased use of radioisotopes has led to increased concerns over the effects of these materials on biological systems (such as humans). When this radiation encounters living cells, it can cause heating, break chemical bonds, or ionize molecules. The most serious biological damage results when these radioactive emissions fragment or ionize molecules. For example, alpha and beta particles emitted from nuclear decay reactions possess much higher energies than ordinary chemical bond energies. When these particles strike and penetrate matter, they produce ions and molecular fragments that are extremely reactive."}
{"question": "When water freezes, it expands in volume as what is formed?", "distractor3": "energy", "distractor1": "movement", "distractor2": "plasma", "correct_answer": "ice", "support": "It can be used to cool food and keep it fresh. It can provide recreation, such as ice-skating. Ice can do great damage when it freezes \u2013 roads can buckle, houses can be damaged, water pipes can burst. All this happens because of a unique property of water and ice. When water freezes, it expands in volume as ice is formed."}
{"question": "What is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding increase in temperature?", "distractor3": "heat dispeller", "distractor1": "heat diffuser", "distractor2": "heat storer", "correct_answer": "heat sink", "support": "Water as a Heat Sink A heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding increase in temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly increasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps keep the body cool. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat. As the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates back to the body core."}
{"question": "The main function of this organ is to filter the blood and remove unwanted red blood cells?", "distractor3": "heart", "distractor1": "pancreas", "distractor2": "kidney", "correct_answer": "spleen", "support": "Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and spleen. The thymus gland produces T cells or T-lymphocytes (see below) and the spleen and tonsils help in fighting infections. The spleen also detects viruses and bacteria and triggers the release of pathogen fighting cells."}
{"question": "What governs motions of stars, galaxies and other celestial objects orbiting one another?", "distractor3": "magnetic force", "distractor1": "electrical force", "distractor2": "frictional force", "correct_answer": "gravitational force", "support": "Hundreds of artificial satellites orbit Earth together with thousands of pieces of debris. The Moon\u2019s orbit about Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets about the Sun are no less interesting. If we look further, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity. All these motions are governed by gravitational force, and it is possible to describe them to various degrees of precision. However, we can describe an important class of orbits without the use of computers, and we shall find it instructive to study them. These orbits have the following characteristics: 1."}

They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the distance over which it is applied. Two examples of machines that work in this way are claw hammers and the rope systems (pulleys) that raise or lower flags on flagpoles. In each case, the direction of the force applied by the user is reversed by the machine. How does this make it easier to do the job?."}
{"question": "A circular coral reef could indicate the earlier existence of what?", "distractor3": "tsunami", "distractor1": "landslide", "distractor2": "avalanche", "correct_answer": "volcano", "support": "Remember that there are many volcanoes in the ocean. Coral reefs can form on volcanoes in tropical water. Eventually the volcano becomes inactive. The mountain subsides and erodes so that it is below sea level. This leaves a circular coral reef ( Figure below )."}
{"question": "Many fungi protect themselves from parasites and predators by producing what?", "distractor3": "pheromes", "distractor1": "gaseous chemicals", "distractor2": "ammonia", "correct_answer": "toxic chemicals", "support": "Many fungi protect themselves from parasites and predators by producing toxic chemicals. Most cases of mushroom poisoning are due to mistaken identity. That\u2019s because many toxic mushrooms look very similar to safe, edible mushrooms. An example is shown in Figure below ."}
{"question": "Acid rain falling in lakes can kill aquatic organisms by lowering what?", "distractor3": "food level", "distractor1": "color level", "distractor2": "saliva level", "correct_answer": "ph level", "support": "If it falls on the ground, it may damage soil and soil organisms.

{"question": "What type of energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position?", "distractor3": "directional energy", "distractor1": "spontaneous energy", "distractor2": "mechanical energy", "correct_answer": "potential energy", "support": "Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position. A bouncing ball at the top of a bounce, just before it starts to fall, has potential energy. Once the ball starts to fall, the potential energy changes to kinetic energy. The potential energy changes to kinetic energy when the ball bounces back up into the air. As the ball gains height, it regains potential energy because of gravity."}
{"question": "What is the amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions called?", "distractor3": "reactant", "distractor1": "solute", "distractor2": "catalytic yield", "correct_answer": "theoretical yield", "support": "In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction\u2019s theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield: percent yield =."}
{"question": "Sometimes referred to as air, what do we call the mixture of gases that surrounds the planet?", "distractor3": "hemisphere", "distractor1": "outer space", "distractor2": "galaxy", "correct_answer": "atmosphere", "support": "Why is Earth the only planet in the solar system known to have life?

{"question": "As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the production of these?", "distractor3": "tributaries - like vesicles", "distractor1": "cyclinder-like vesicles", "distractor2": "square-like vesicles", "correct_answer": "sac-like vesicles", "support": "Primary Vesicles As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the production of sac-like vesicles. Similar to a child\u2019s balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins to take on a new shape. These vesicles are given names that are based on Greek words, the main root word being enkephalon, which means \u201cbrain\u201d (en- = \u201cinside\u201d; kephalon = \u201chead\u201d). The prosencephalon (pros- = \u201cin front\u201d) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean forebrain. The mesencephalon (mes- = \u201cmiddle\u201d) is the next vesicle, which can be called the midbrain. The third vesicle at this stage is the rhombencephalon. The first part of this word is also the root of the word rhombus, which is a geometrical figure with four sides of equal length (a square is a rhombus with 90\u00b0 angles). Whereas prosencephalon and mesencephalon translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for \u201cfour-sided-figure-brain. One way of thinking about how the brain is arranged is to use these three regions\u2014forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain\u2014which are based on the primary vesicle stage of development (Figure 13.3a)."}

{"question": "What is the term for the flow of charge that a voltage source creates?", "distractor3": "velocity", "distractor1": "force", "distractor2": "output", "correct_answer": "current", "support": "Voltage is similar to fluid pressure. The voltage source is like a pump, creating a pressure difference, causing current\u2014the flow of charge. The resistor is like a pipe that reduces pressure and limits flow because of its resistance. The voltage source supplies energy (causing an electric field and a current), and the resistor converts it to another form (such as thermal energy). In a simple circuit (one with a single simple resistor), the voltage supplied by the source equals the voltage drop across the resistor, since PE = q\u0394V , and the same q flows through each. Thus the energy supplied by the voltage source and the energy converted by the resistor are equal. (See Figure 20.9."}
{"question": "What happens to a cell's efficiency as it grows in size?", "distractor3": "multiplies", "distractor1": "increases", "distractor2": "splits in half", "correct_answer": "decreases", "support": "Small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. First, we\u2019ll consider the area and volume of a typical cell. Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube (Figure 4.7). If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume. In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become more efficient is to divide; another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks. These adaptations lead to the development of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells."}

{"question": "What does fluoride in toothpaste help prevent?", "distractor3": "plaque build up", "distractor1": "cavities", "distractor2": "gum disease", "correct_answer": "tooth decay", "support": "Unfortunately, excess fluoride can negate its advantages. The most serious side effect of excess fluoride is the bone disease, skeletal fluorosis. When excess fluoride is in the body, it can cause the joints to stiffen and the bones to thicken. It can severely impact mobility and can negatively affect the thyroid gland. Skeletal fluorosis is a condition that over 2.7 million people suffer from across the world. So while fluoride can protect our teeth from decay, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum level of 4 ppm (4 mg/ L) of fluoride in drinking water in the US. Fluoride levels in water are not regulated in all countries, so fluorosis is a problem in areas with high levels of fluoride in the groundwater."}

There are also low-pressure baroreceptors located in the walls of the venae cavae and right atrium. When blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched more tightly and initiate action potentials at a higher rate. At lower blood pressures, the degree of stretch is lower and the rate of firing is slower. When the cardiovascular center in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis (Figure 20.18): \u2022 When blood pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic stimulation of the heart. As a result, cardiac output falls. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to fall. \u2022 When blood pressure drops too low, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases. It will also trigger sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral vessels, resulting in vasoconstriction. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to rise."}

Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her baby during childbirth."}
{"question": "Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can reproduce themselves via cell division, sometimes after years of inactivity. under certain conditions, they may differentiate into tissue-specific or organ-specific cells with special these?", "distractor3": "enzymes", "distractor1": "chromosomes", "distractor2": "mutations", "correct_answer": "functions", "support": "In some cases, stem cells may continually divide to produce a mature cell and to replace themselves. Stem cell therapy has an enormous potential to improve the quality of life or save the lives of people suffering from debilitating or lifethreatening diseases. There have been several studies in animals, but since stem cell therapy is still in its infancy, there have been limited experiments in humans. It affects 7\u201310 percent of all hospitalized patients, resulting in the deaths of 35\u201340 percent of inpatients. In limited studies using mesenchymal stem cells, there have been fewer instances of kidney damage after surgery, the length of hospital stays has been reduced, and there have been fewer readmissions after release. How do these stem cells work to protect or repair the kidney? Scientists are unsure at this point, but some evidence has shown that these stem cells release several growth factors in endocrine and paracrine ways. As further studies are conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of stem cell therapy, we will move closer to a day when kidney injury is rare, and curative treatments are routine."}
{"question": "What is the process of soil dissolving in rain called?", "distractor3": "migration", "distractor1": "abrasion", "distractor2": "sedimentation", "correct_answer": "erosion", "support": "Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur. It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily."}
{"question": "What are all living things on earth formed of?", "distractor3": "iron compounds", "distractor1": "dioxide compounds", "distractor2": "hydrogen compounds", "correct_answer": "carbon compounds", "support": "Introduction All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and CO2. Today, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry."}
{"question": "What is another name for critical speed?", "distractor3": "impossible velocity", "distractor1": "normal speed", "distractor2": "gravity", "correct_answer": "terminal speed", "support": "accelerate indefinitely (as it would if we neglect air resistance, for example). Instead, viscous drag increases, slowing acceleration, until a critical speed, called the terminal speed, is reached and the acceleration of the object becomes zero. Once this happens, the object continues to fall at constant speed (the terminal speed). This is the case for particles of sand falling in the ocean, cells falling in a centrifuge, and sky divers falling through the air. Figure 12.19 shows some of the factors that affect terminal speed. But there is also a buoyant force that depends on the density of the object relative to the fluid. Thus a skydiver falls more slowly with outspread limbs than when they are in a pike position\u2014head first with hands at their side and legs together. It can be difficult to find small ball bearings around the house, but a small marble will do. Gather two or three fluids (syrup, motor oil, honey, olive oil, etc. ) and a thick, tall clear glass or vase. Does it make a difference if the marble is dropped near the side of the glass? Knowledge of terminal speed is useful for estimating sedimentation rates of small particles. We know from watching mud settle out of dirty water that sedimentation is usually a slow process. Centrifuges are used to speed sedimentation by creating accelerated frames in which gravitational acceleration is replaced by centripetal acceleration, which can be much greater, increasing the terminal speed."}
{"question": "Prokaryotes are much simpler than what in many of their features?", "distractor3": "microorganisms", "distractor1": "meteorites", "distractor2": "membranes", "correct_answer": "eukaryotes", "support": "Some of the salient features are that the two strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel in nature. Deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the structure, and the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. The diameter of the double helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. During cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of the DNA by a process known as DNA replication. Prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome. In general, eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear DNA molecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different states of packaging and compaction."}

{"question": "An apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital regions. apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even reaching this?", "distractor3": "stratum corneum", "distractor1": "epidermis", "distractor2": "papillary dermis", "correct_answer": "hypodermis", "support": "An apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital regions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even reaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts, apocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition and subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the poorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based compound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat."}

{"question": "Prokaryotes are unicellular organisms that lack organelles surrounded by what?", "distractor3": "tissues", "distractor1": "particles", "distractor2": "cells", "correct_answer": "membranes", "support": "The Prokaryotic Cell Recall that prokaryotes (Figure 13.5) are unicellular organisms that lack organelles surrounded by membranes. Therefore, they do not have a nucleus but instead have a single chromosome\u2014a piece of circular DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall lying outside the plasma membrane. The cell wall functions as a protective layer and is responsible for the organism\u2019s shape. Some other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others. For example, the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces and protects it from dehydration. Plasmids, which consist of small, circular pieces of DNA outside of the main chromosome, are also present in many species of bacteria."}

In contrast, fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate deep into organic matter. Fungi are also the only decomposers that can break down tough plant substances, including lignin (in wood) and cellulose (in plant cell walls). They have special enzymes to do this work. Because of these abilities, fungi are the primary decomposers in forests (see Figure below )."}
{"question": "In diffusion, substances tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of what kind of concentration?", "distractor3": "Increase", "distractor1": "drop", "distractor2": "rise", "correct_answer": "low", "support": "Diffusion Diffusion is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people. The ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room. The ammonia vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. On the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the gradient is eliminated."}

{"question": "Why is it easier to move boxes on a wheeled dolly than by sliding them?", "distractor3": "more total work", "distractor1": "starting friction", "distractor2": "increase surface tension", "correct_answer": "rolling friction", "support": "Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why it is much easier to move boxes on a wheeled dolly than by carrying or sliding them. It also explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including cars, 4-wheelers, bicycles, roller skates, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction (see Figure below ). They allow parts of a wheel or other machine to roll rather than slide over one another."}
{"question": "What is the protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen in the bloodstream?", "distractor3": "plasma", "distractor1": "rH factor", "distractor2": "insulin", "correct_answer": "hemoglobin", "support": "Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen in the bloodstream.

The vertebrates contain more than 60,000 described species, divided into major groupings of the lampreys, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Animals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail (Figure 15.33). In certain groups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development. The chordates are named for the notochord, which is a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime. In vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (the spine). In chordates, it is located dorsally to the notochord. In contrast, other animal phyla possess solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally. Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx, the region just posterior to the mouth, that extend to the outside environment. In organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. In fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, jaw supports."}

The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity. Large Intestine The large intestine, illustrated in Figure 34.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The colon is home to many bacteria or \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestive processes. The colon can be divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. Carnivorous mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet."}

{"question": "What is the mode of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require the cognitive thought of the individual?", "distractor3": "forced breathing", "distractor1": "conscious breathing", "distractor2": "small breathing", "correct_answer": "quiet breathing", "support": "There are different types, or modes, of breathing that require a slightly different process to allow inspiration and expiration. Quiet breathing, also known as eupnea, is a mode of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require the cognitive thought of the individual. As the diaphragm relaxes, air passively leaves the lungs. A shallow breath, called costal breathing, requires contraction of the intercostal muscles. In contrast, forced breathing, also known as hyperpnea, is a mode of breathing that can occur during exercise or actions that require the active manipulation of breathing, such as singing. In addition to the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, other accessory muscles must also contract. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the scalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. During forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. This helps to push the diaphragm further into the thorax, pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the internal intercostals) help to compress the rib cage, which also reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity."}

The longer the amount of time since species diverged, the more differences there will be in their DNA or proteins."}
{"question": "Electric motors transform electrical energy into what other form of energy?", "distractor3": "solar", "distractor1": "magnetic", "distractor2": "thermal", "correct_answer": "kinetic", "support": "An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. Figure below shows a simple diagram of an electric motor. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet turns, causing the shaft to turn as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device."}
{"question": "How often an allele occurs in a gene pool relative to the other alleles for that gene is known as _______", "distractor3": "genetic rate", "distractor1": "allele succession", "distractor2": "genomic frequency", "correct_answer": "allele frequency", "support": "Allele frequency is how often an allele occurs in a gene pool relative to the other alleles for that gene. Look at the example in Table below . The population in the table has 100 members. Therefore, the total number of copies of each gene in the gene pool is 200. The gene in the example exists in the gene pool in two forms, alleles A and a . The table shows how this is done."}
{"question": "If more coils are added to an electromagnet it becomes?", "distractor3": "brighter", "distractor1": "lighter", "distractor2": "weaker", "correct_answer": "stronger", "support": "The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also increases an electromagnet\u2019s strength. At the following URL, you can see an animation demonstrating how these factors affect the strength of an electromagnet. http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/Electromagnet/index.html."}
{"question": "Which trait of particles causes even cold objects to have some thermal energy?", "distractor3": "kinetic energy", "distractor1": "equilibrium", "distractor2": "momentum", "correct_answer": "constant random motion", "support": "Scientists think that multicellularity arose from cooperation between many organisms of the same species. The Colonial Theory proposes that this cooperation led to the development of a multicellular organism. Some of these amoebas then become slightly differentiated from each other. Volvox, shown in Figure above , is another example of a colonial organism. Most scientists accept that the Colonial theory explains how multicellular organisms evolved."}
{"question": "What is it called when two organisms live close together and form a relationship?", "distractor3": "Family", "distractor1": "definitions", "distractor2": "traits", "correct_answer": "symbiosis", "support": "Fungi don't live in isolation. They often interact with other species. In fact, fungi can be dependent on another organism for survival. Symbiosis can be beneficial to one or both organisms, or sometimes one organism hurts the other. Some of the partners in these relationships include plants, algae, insects and other animals, and even humans."}
{"question": "What does fsh help stimulate in the ovaries and sperm in the testes?", "distractor3": "spawning", "distractor1": "in vitro fertilization", "distractor2": "dna replication", "correct_answer": "maturation of eggs", "support": "Peptide and Protein Hormones Whereas the amine hormones are derived from a single amino acid, peptide and protein hormones consist of multiple amino acids that link to form an amino acid chain. Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids, whereas protein hormones are longer polypeptides. Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into an amino acid chain. Some examples of protein hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which has an attached carbohydrate group and is thus classified as a glycoprotein. FSH helps stimulate the maturation of eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes."}
{"question": "The largest phylum of the animal kingdom is what?", "distractor3": "crustaceans", "distractor1": "cephalopods", "distractor2": "mammals", "correct_answer": "arthropods", "support": "Arthropods are not only the largest phylum of invertebrates.

{"question": "During what process is light from the star focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner?", "distractor3": "macrolensing", "distractor1": "spectrometry", "distractor2": "excitation", "correct_answer": "microlensing", "support": "In a process called microlensing, light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner. Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there. To date, a few MACHOs have been observed, but not predominantly in galactic halos, nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter. MACHOs are among the most conventional of unseen objects proposed to explain dark matter. Old remnants of stars called white dwarfs are also under consideration, since they contain about a solar mass, but are small as the Earth and may dim to the point that we ordinarily do not observe them. While white dwarfs are known, old dim ones are not. There is a very real possibility that dark matter is composed of the known neutrinos, which may have small, but finite, masses. As discussed earlier, neutrinos are thought to be massless, but we only have upper limits on their masses, rather than knowing they are exactly zero. So far, these upper limits come from difficult measurements of total energy emitted in the decays and reactions in which neutrinos are involved. We have noted in Particles, Patterns, and Conservation Laws that there are three flavors of neutrinos ( \u03bd e ,."}
{"question": "Much like the processes of dna replication and transcription, translation consists of three main stages: initiation, elongation, and this?", "distractor3": "detonation", "distractor1": "isolation", "distractor2": "assimilation", "correct_answer": "termination", "support": "Much like the processes of DNA replication and transcription, translation consists of three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an mRNA transcript. This attachment takes place with the assistance of various enzymes and requires energy. The tRNA molecule then releases the mRNA strand, the mRNA strand shifts one codon over in the ribosome, and the next appropriate tRNA arrives with its matching anticodon. This process continues until the final codon on the mRNA is reached which provides a \u201cstop\u201d message that signals termination of translation and triggers the release of the complete, newly synthesized protein. Thus, a gene within the DNA molecule is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein product (Figure 3.29)."}
{"question": "What is an organic compound that is the primary component of natural gas?", "distractor3": "sulfur", "distractor1": "ethanol", "distractor2": "magnesium", "correct_answer": "methane", "support": "Methane is an organic compound that is the primary component of natural gas. Its structure consists of a central carbon atom with four single bonds to hydrogen atoms (see Figure below ). Instead, each of the hydrogen atoms lies at the corners of a geometrical shape called a tetrahedron. The carbon atom is at the center of the tetrahedron. Each face of a tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle."}
{"question": "Manganin is made up of metals that include copper, manganese and nickel - what do you generally call a metal of this type?", "distractor3": "mixed metal", "distractor1": "complex metal", "distractor2": "silicon", "correct_answer": "alloy", "support": "Some alloys have been developed specifically to have a small temperature dependence. Manganin (which is made of copper, manganese and nickel), for example, has \u03b1 close to zero (to three digits on the scale in Table 20.2), and so its resistivity varies only slightly with temperature. This is useful for making a temperature-independent resistance standard, for example."}
{"question": "Protons and neutrons are located in which central part of the atom?", "distractor3": "radius", "distractor1": "shell", "distractor2": "nucleolus", "correct_answer": "nucleus", "support": "Electrons have almost no mass. Instead, almost all the mass of an atom is in its protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The nucleus is very small, but it is densely packed with matter. The SI unit for the mass of an atom is the atomic mass unit (amu) . One atomic mass unit equals the mass of a proton, which is about 1.7 \u00d7 10 -24 g. Each neutron also has a mass of 1 amu."}
{"question": "Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate this?", "distractor3": "respiration", "distractor1": "blood flow", "distractor2": "digestion", "correct_answer": "cell cycle", "support": "The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood cancer)."}
{"question": "Slabs of continents moving around on earth's surface is called what?", "distractor3": "fault tectonics", "distractor1": "edge tectonics", "distractor2": "crator tectonics", "correct_answer": "plate tectonics", "support": "Plate tectonics theory says that slabs of continents move around on Earth's surface. Plate tectonics explain many things about Earth: (1) geological activity, why it happens where it does; (2) natural resources, why many are found where they are; and (3) the past and future, what happened in the past and what will happen in the future. The theory of plate tectonics will be explored in the chapter Plate Tectonics ."}

This can make colloidal mixtures appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in Figure 11.31. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out."}
{"question": "Vascular and non-vascular are two groups of what kind of organism?", "distractor3": "fungi", "distractor1": "animals", "distractor2": "vertebrates", "correct_answer": "plants", "support": "The Major Divisions of Land Plants The green algae and land plants are grouped together into a subphylum called the Streptophytina, and thus are called Streptophytes. In a further division, land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in Figure 25.6. Plants that lack vascular tissue, which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients, are referred to as non-vascular plants. Liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless, non-vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution. Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes. The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician and were probably similar to lycophytes, which include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). The seed plants, or spermatophytes, form the largest group of all existing plants, and hence dominate the landscape."}
{"question": "What do you call geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species?", "distractor3": "endospots", "distractor1": "warmspots", "distractor2": "multispots", "correct_answer": "hotspots", "support": "A simple measure of success in setting aside preserves for biodiversity protection is to set a target percentage of land or marine habitat to protect. However, a more detailed preserve design and choice of location is usually necessary because of the way protected lands are allocated and how biodiversity is distributed: protected lands tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being set aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk. For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species. Researchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required. A biodiversity hotspot is a conservation concept developed by Norman Myers in 1988. Hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet."}
{"question": "What cells secrete signaling molecules that promote sperm production and can control whether germ cells live or die?", "distractor3": "egg cells", "distractor1": "erythrocytes", "distractor2": "neurons", "correct_answer": "sertoli cells", "support": "Sertoli cells are a type of supporting cell called a sustentacular cell, or sustenocyte, that are typically found in epithelial tissue. Sertoli cells secrete signaling molecules that promote sperm production and can control whether germ cells live or die. They extend physically around the germ cells from the peripheral basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules to the lumen. Tight junctions between these sustentacular cells create the blood\u2013testis barrier, which keeps bloodborne substances from reaching the germ cells and, at the same time, keeps surface antigens on developing germ cells from escaping into the bloodstream and prompting an autoimmune response."}
{"question": "Invertebrate chordates use what to filter food out of water?", "distractor3": "nose", "distractor1": "pores", "distractor2": "tails", "correct_answer": "gills", "support": "In the early evolution of fish, there was a switch to using gills to absorb oxygen instead of to filter food. Gills consist of many thin, folded tissues that provide a large surface area for oxygen uptake. With more oxygen absorbed by the gills, fish could become much larger and more active."}
{"question": "Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps doing what?", "distractor3": "decreasing", "distractor1": "increasing", "distractor2": "changing", "correct_answer": "reversing", "support": "The transformer in the diagram consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core. Each coil is part of a different circuit. Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps reversing. This is where electromagnetic induction comes in. The changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S of the other circuit."}
{"question": "When heat moves out of a system, what is the sign of the enthalpy?", "distractor3": "N/A (zero)", "distractor1": "it depends", "distractor2": "positive", "correct_answer": "negative", "support": "where H is the enthalpy of the system, E is the internal energy, P is the pressure, and V is the volume. Heat measures the transfer of thermal energy between two objects, and enthalpy measures the flow of heat. When heat flows out of a system, the change in enthalpy is negative; when heat flows into a system, the change in enthalpy is positive. Enthalpy is a useful tool for characterizing chemical reactions."}
{"question": "During unfavorable conditions, mature seeds may enter a period of inactivity or extremely low metabolic activity called what?", "distractor3": "malignancy", "distractor1": "hibernation", "distractor2": "germination", "correct_answer": "dormancy", "support": "Seed Germination Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity, or extremely low metabolic activity: a process known as dormancy, which may last for months, years or even centuries. Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions. Upon a return to favorable conditions, seed germination takes place. After heavy rains, many new seedlings emerge. Some seeds require vernalization (cold treatment) before they can germinate. Scarification, which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat, is often employed before germination. Presoaking in hot water, or passing through an acid environment, such as an animal\u2019s digestive tract, may also be employed. Depending on seed size, the time taken for a seedling to emerge may vary. Species with large seeds have enough food reserves to germinate deep below ground, and still extend their epicotyl all the way to the soil surface. Seeds of smallseeded species usually require light as a germination cue. This ensures the seeds only germinate at or near the soil surface (where the light is greatest). If they were to germinate too far underneath the surface, the developing seedling would not have enough food reserves to reach the sunlight."}
{"question": "What everyday beverage commodity is second only to oil in worldwide trade?", "distractor3": "beer", "distractor1": "water", "distractor2": "soda", "correct_answer": "coffee", "support": "Across the globe, people love coffee\u2019s aroma and taste.

These batteries must operate in an upright position so the liquid material does not spill out. In contrast, dry cell batteries contain a paste that serves as the positive electrode."}
{"question": "Stp, which is important in determining information about gas behavior and properties, stands for standard temperature and what?", "distractor3": "push", "distractor1": "pull", "distractor2": "power", "correct_answer": "pressure", "support": "It should be obvious by now that some physical properties of gases depend strongly on the conditions. What we need is a set of standard conditions so that properties of gases can be properly compared to each other. For simplicity, we will use 1 atm as standard pressure. Defining STP allows us to compare more directly the properties of gases that differ from each other. One property shared among gases is a molar volume. The molar volume is the volume of 1 mol of a gas."}
{"question": "Within a particular habitat, what can be characterized by its size or density?", "distractor3": "percent", "distractor1": "total", "distractor2": "group", "correct_answer": "population", "support": "Population Size and Density The study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist, and how closely associated they are with each other. Within a particular habitat, a population can be characterized by its population size (N), the total number of individuals, and its population density, the number of individuals within a specific area or volume. Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations. For example, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their potential to adapt to the environment. As is shown in Figure 45.2, smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms."}

Predation is when a predator organism feeds on another living organism or organisms, known as prey . It does this by keeping the prey from surviving, reproducing, or both. Predator-prey relationships are essential to maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra, the bear and fish, and the fox and rabbit."}
{"question": "The 'boy in the bubble' is a classic example of someone suffering what type of disease that can cause opportunistic infections?", "distractor3": "hydroencephaly", "distractor1": "muscular dystrophy", "distractor2": "retardation", "correct_answer": "inherited immunodeficiency", "support": "Inherited Immunodeficiencies A list of all inherited immunodeficiencies is well beyond the scope of this book. The list is almost as long as the list of cells, proteins, and signaling molecules of the immune system itself. Others are more severe in their consequences. What groups them together is the fact that both the B cell and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are affected. Children with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive a bone marrow transplant. Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the \u201cboy in the bubble,\u201d who was treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his death from infection in 1984. One of the features that make bone marrow transplants work as well as they do is the proliferative capability of hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. Only a small amount of bone marrow from a healthy donor is given intravenously to the recipient. New treatments for SCID using gene therapy, inserting nondefective genes into cells taken from the patient and giving them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants. Although not a standard treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow transplantation has failed."}

{"question": "What controls what goes in and out of a cell?", "distractor3": "the mitochondria", "distractor1": "the cilia", "distractor2": "the nucleus", "correct_answer": "the plasma membrane", "support": "The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell. Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not completely permeable. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is semipermeable , meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot."}
{"question": "If the average binding energy per nucleon overcomes the repulsion, the nucleus stays together and it referred to as what?", "distractor3": "closed", "distractor1": "even", "distractor2": "solid", "correct_answer": "stable", "support": "Each nucleus, therefore, has competing forces. The repulsive force between the protons tends to blow the nucleus apart and the binding energy tends to hold the nucleus together. If the average binding energy per nucleon overcomes the repulsion, the nucleus stays together and it referred to as stable. When a nucleus disintegrates, it throws off pieces of itself and energy in the form of gamma rays . This disintegration process came to be called radioactivity ."}

Dark areas in the original block the light and generate an invisible, positively charged image. The heaviest chalcogen, polonium, was isolated after an extraordinary effort by Marie Curie. (For more information on radioactivity and polonium, see Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Chemistry\", Section 1.5 \"The Atom\". ) Although she was never able to obtain macroscopic quantities of the element, which she named for her native country of Poland, she demonstrated that its chemistry required it to be assigned to group 16."}
{"question": "When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, the vapor in the container is then said to be in what with the liquid?", "distractor3": "balance", "distractor1": "stability", "distractor2": "synchronization", "correct_answer": "equilibrium", "support": "Vaporization and Condensation When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some cases, these collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases."}

{"question": "What makes nobel gases unreactive?", "distractor3": "fusion", "distractor1": "chemical reaction", "distractor2": "magnetism", "correct_answer": "its electon configuration", "support": "The noble gases are unreactive because of their electron configurations. American chemist Gilbert Lewis (1875-1946) used this observation to explain the types of ions and molecules that are formed by other elements. He called his explanation the octet rule. A broader statement that encompasses both the octet rule and this exception is that atoms react in order to achieve the same valence electron configuration as that of the nearest noble gas. Most noble gases have eight valence electrons, but because the first principal energy level can hold a maximum of two electrons, the first noble gas (helium) needs only two valence electrons to fill its outermost energy level. As a result, the nearby elements hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium tend to form stable compounds by achieving a total of two valence electrons."}

Many solids composed of ions can also be quite brittle. Solids usually have their constituent particles arranged in a regular, three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions called a crystal. The effect of this regular arrangement of particles is sometimes visible macroscopically, as shown in Figure 8.7 \"Crystalline Arrangement\". Some solids, especially those composed of large molecules, cannot easily organize their particles in such regular crystals and exist as amorphous (literally, \u201cwithout form\u201d) solids. Glass is one example of an amorphous solid."}
{"question": "What kind of feeders are sponges?", "distractor3": "primary feeders", "distractor1": "bottom feeders", "distractor2": "surface feeders", "correct_answer": "filter feeders", "support": "Sponges are filter feeders. They pump water into their body through their pores. As the water flows by, specialized collar cells (which are also known as choanocytes) filter out food particles such as bacteria. Once the food is trapped, the collar cells digest it (see Figure below ). Cells called amebocytes also help digest the food. They distribute the nutrients to the rest of the body as well. Finally, the water flows back out of the body through an opening called the osculum . As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponge\u2019s cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water for removal through the osculum."}

{"question": "What do plant viruses have that protect their cells?", "distractor3": "nuclei wall", "distractor1": "proteins wall", "distractor2": "inner wall", "correct_answer": "cell wall", "support": "Plant Viruses Plant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either DNA or RNA. You have already learned about one of these, the tobacco mosaic virus. As plant viruses have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. This damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plant\u2019s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. When plants viruses are transferred between different plants, this is known as horizontal transmission, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called vertical transmission. Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (Table 21.4). Other viruses induce hypoplasia, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves, black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf."}

The sympathetic nervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall that sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when it becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat (insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures, vigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the sweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated."}
{"question": "What in the air allows us to hear sound?", "distractor3": "rain", "distractor1": "wind", "distractor2": "water", "correct_answer": "gases", "support": "Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves.

While the bones of the two correspond, the parts serve different functions in each organism and their forms have adapted to follow that function. 30 Centrioles and flagella are alike in that they are made up of microtubules. This arrangement does not occur in flagella. 32 They differ because plant cell walls are rigid. Plasmodesmata, which a plant cell needs for transportation and communication, are able to allow movement of really large molecules. Gap junctions are necessary in animal cells for transportation and communication."}
{"question": "If a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it will not have what?", "distractor3": "temperature", "distractor1": "color", "distractor2": "taste", "correct_answer": "smell", "support": "Tastes and Odors Both taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment. The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. The first four tastes need little explanation. The taste of umami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that molecule has no smell. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors. Although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor. A person\u2019s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages."}
{"question": "The cephalic phase (reflex phase) of gastric secretion, which is relatively brief, takes place before food enters where?", "distractor3": "skin", "distractor1": "respiratory", "distractor2": "Head", "correct_answer": "stomach", "support": "The cephalic phase (reflex phase) of gastric secretion, which is relatively brief, takes place before food enters the stomach. The smell, taste, sight, or thought of food triggers this phase. This enhanced secretion is a conditioned reflex, meaning it occurs only if you like or want a particular food. Depression and loss of appetite can suppress the cephalic reflex. The gastric phase of secretion lasts 3 to 4 hours, and is set in motion by local neural and hormonal mechanisms triggered by the entry of food into the stomach."}

{"question": "The force exerted by the atmosphere on the earth\u2019s surface can be measured with what instrument?", "distractor3": "anemometer", "distractor1": "mass spectrometer", "distractor2": "Geiger counter", "correct_answer": "barometer", "support": "A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere."}
{"question": "What term describes the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a given amount?", "distractor3": "boiling point", "distractor1": "elastic collision", "distractor2": "viscosity", "correct_answer": "surface tension", "support": "Summary Surface tension is the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a given amount. The stronger the intermolecular interactions, the greater the surface tension. Surfactants are molecules, such as soaps and detergents, that reduce the surface tension of polar liquids like water. The shape of the meniscus, the upper surface of a liquid in a tube, also reflects the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. The viscosity of a liquid is its resistance to flow. Liquids that have strong intermolecular forces tend to have high viscosities."}
{"question": "Because water expands when it freezes, what property of water is lower when it is in a solid state than a liquid?", "distractor3": "salinity", "distractor1": "mass", "distractor2": "volume", "correct_answer": "density", "support": "The melting point of water is 0\u00b0C. Unlike most chemical substances, water in a solid state has a lower density than water in a liquid state. This is because water expands when it freezes. Again, hydrogen bonding is the reason. As a result, water molecules are spaced farther apart in ice, giving ice a lower density than liquid water. A substance with lower density floats on a substance with higher density. This explains why ice floats on liquid water, whereas many other solids sink to the bottom of liquid water."}

{"question": "What encloses and defines the borders of cells?", "distractor3": "clear membranes", "distractor1": "cells membranes", "distractor2": "artificial membranes", "correct_answer": "plasma membranes", "support": "The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane, forming complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the membrane is due to temperature, the configuration of the fatty acid tails (some kinked by double bonds), the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate combinations, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose and define the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux."}

The state of a system is a complete description of a system at a given time, including its temperature and pressure, the amount of matter it contains, its chemical composition, and the physical state of the matter. The temperature of an oven, for example, is independent of however many steps it may have taken for it to reach that temperature. Similarly, the pressure in a tire is independent of how often air is pumped into the tire for it to reach that pressure, as is the final volume of air in the tire. Heat and work, on the other hand, are not state functions because they are path dependent. For example, a car sitting on the top level of a parking garage has the same potential energy whether it was lifted by a crane, set there by a helicopter, driven up, or pushed up by a group of students (). The amount of work expended to get it there, however, can differ greatly depending on the path chosen. If the students decided to carry the car to the top of the ramp, they would perform a great deal more work than if they simply pushed the car up the ramp (unless, of course, they neglected to release the parking brake, in which case the work expended would increase substantially!)."}

A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all human cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic cells. Somatic cells contain two copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). The human is a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of having pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy. Cells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract must be frequently replaced when constantly \u201cworn off\u201d by the movement of food through the gut. The cell cycle is the sequence of events in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then divides itself, generating two new cells."}

What is the temperature when the water and pan reach thermal equilibrium a short time later? Strategy The pan is placed on an insulated pad so that little heat transfer occurs with the surroundings. Originally the pan and water are not in thermal equilibrium: the pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Because heat transfer between the pan and water takes place rapidly, the mass of evaporated water is negligible and the magnitude of the heat lost by the pan is equal to the heat gained by the water. The exchange of heat stops once a thermal equilibrium between the pan and the water is achieved. The heat exchange can be written as \u2223 Q hot \u2223 = Q cold ."}

{"question": "What process do single cell organisms use to remove waste and get nutrients into their cell?", "distractor3": "Measured", "distractor1": "convection", "distractor2": "filtration", "correct_answer": "diffusion", "support": "If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. If the cell is too large, then diffusion is ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste. Recall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surfaceto-volume ratio. Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4\u03c0r2, and a volume of (4/3)\u03c0r3. The surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less efficient. The solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. Specialization occurs in complex organisms, allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. Other organ systems have developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. Moreover, surface-tovolume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional surface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat."}

Smooth muscle cells can undergo hyperplasia, mitotically dividing to produce new cells. The smooth cells are nonstriated, but their sarcoplasm is filled with actin and myosin, along with dense bodies in the sarcolemma to anchor the thin filaments and a network of intermediate filaments involved in pulling the sarcolemma toward the fiber\u2019s middle, shortening it in the process. Ca++ ions trigger contraction when they are released from SR and enter through opened voltage-gated calcium channels. Smooth muscle can be stimulated by pacesetter cells, by the autonomic nervous system, by hormones, spontaneously, or by stretching. The fibers in some smooth muscle have latch-bridges, crossbridges that cycle slowly without the need for ATP; these muscles can maintain low-level contractions for long periods. Single-unit smooth muscle tissue contains gap junctions to synchronize membrane depolarization and contractions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. Single-unit smooth muscle in the walls of the viscera, called visceral muscle, has a stress-relaxation response that permits muscle to stretch, contract, and relax as the organ expands."}

{"question": "Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of pigments associated with what process and found in plants and algae?", "distractor3": "glycolysis", "distractor1": "mitosis", "distractor2": "osmosis", "correct_answer": "photosynthesis", "support": "Pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color. Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has multiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion. With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit\u2014such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (\u03b2-carotene)\u2014are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the absorption spectrum. Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green."}
{"question": "What device measures atmospheric pressure and can be used as an altimeter?", "distractor3": "indicator", "distractor1": "thermometer", "distractor2": "speedometer", "correct_answer": "barometer", "support": "A barometer is a device that measures atmospheric pressure. This device measures atmospheric pressure, rather than gauge pressure, because there is a nearly pure vacuum above the mercury in the tube. When atmospheric pressure varies, the mercury rises or falls, giving important clues to weather forecasters. The barometer can also be used as an altimeter, since average atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. Mercury barometers and manometers are so common that units of mm Hg are often quoted for atmospheric pressure and blood pressures. Table 11.2 gives conversion factors for some of the more commonly used units of pressure."}

Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, and this process continues until the substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions of more than one substance, each type of molecule diffuses according to its own concentration gradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, the sizes of the particles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the system. Some materials diffuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is only made possible by protein channels and carriers. In living systems, diffusion of some substances would be slow or difficult without membrane proteins."}

{"question": "Cross-pollination\u2014or out-crossing\u2014leads to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from what?", "distractor3": "dead plants", "distractor1": "the same species", "distractor2": "the same plant", "correct_answer": "different plants", "support": "Explore this interactive website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/pollination) to review self-pollination and crosspollination. Living species are designed to ensure survival of their progeny; those that fail become extinct. Genetic diversity is therefore required so that in changing environmental or stress conditions, some of the progeny can survive. Self-pollination leads to the production of plants with less genetic diversity, since genetic material from the same plant is used to form gametes, and eventually, the zygote. In some species, the pollen and the ovary mature at different times. These flowers make self-pollination nearly impossible. By the time pollen matures and has been shed, the stigma of this flower is mature and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower. Insects easily cross-pollinate while seeking the nectar at the bottom of the pollen tube. This phenomenon is also known as heterostyly. Many plants, such as cucumber, have male and female flowers located on different parts of the plant, thus making self-pollination difficult. In yet other species, the male and female flowers are borne on different plants (dioecious). All of these are barriers to self-pollination; therefore, the plants depend on pollinators to transfer pollen. The majority of pollinators are biotic agents such as insects (like bees, flies, and butterflies), bats, birds, and other animals. Other plant species are pollinated by abiotic agents, such as wind and water."}

{"question": "The earliest known mammal fossils are from which period?", "distractor3": "Cretaceous Period", "distractor1": "Tertiary", "distractor2": "Mesosoic period", "correct_answer": "early jurassic", "support": "The later synapsids, which had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals, possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth, which are specialized for chewing, mechanically breaking down food to speed digestion and releasing the energy needed to produce heat. Chewing also requires the ability to chew and breathe at the same time, which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate. A secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in cynodonts and mammals. The jawbone also shows changes from early synapsids to later ones. The zygomatic arch, or cheekbone, is present in mammals and advanced therapsids such as cynodonts, but is not present in pelycosaurs. The presence of the zygomatic arch suggests the presence of the masseter muscle, which closes the jaw and functions in chewing. In the appendicular skeleton, the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates in that it does not possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle, and the scapula is the dominant bone. Mammals evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early Jurassic period, some 205 million years ago. Early mammals were small, about the size of a small rodent. Mammals first began to diversify in the Mesozoic Era, from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods, although most of these mammals were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic."}

The undigested food material enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle and is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required to set up the urge to eliminate."}
{"question": "Mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of chromosomes identified by what letters?", "distractor3": "y and z", "distractor1": "a and b", "distractor2": "rna and dna", "correct_answer": "x and y", "support": "Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system. The sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or \u201cfirst female,\u201d if it is male first, its termed protandry or \u201cfirst male."}

However, trillions of bacteria live within the large intestine and are referred to as the bacterial flora. Most of the more than 700 species of these bacteria are nonpathogenic commensal organisms that cause no harm as long as they stay in the gut lumen. In fact, many facilitate chemical digestion and absorption, and some synthesize certain vitamins, mainly biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K. Some are linked to increased immune response. First, peptidoglycan, a component of bacterial cell walls, activates the release of chemicals by the mucosa\u2019s epithelial cells, which draft immune cells, especially dendritic cells, into the mucosa. The dendritic cells with antigens then travel to neighboring lymphoid follicles in the mucosa where T cells inspect for antigens. This process triggers an IgA-mediated response, if warranted, in the lumen that blocks the commensal organisms from infiltrating the mucosa and setting off a far greater, widespread systematic reaction."}

Could a clone , a genetically exact copy of an organism, be developed using techniques associated with biotechnology? It \"simply\" involves the removal of the nucleus from a somatic cell and its placement into an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed. This new cell would mimic the zygote, the first diploid cell of a new organism. This new zygote is allowed to become established, and a few days later is placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother. Theoretically this would result in an individual genetically identical to the donor. Obviously, there are many ethical and legal issues associated with human cloning, and of course, it is not a \"simple\" procedure."}

During meiosis, two nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell\u2019s life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis. Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. The diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis I to produce two haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis II to produce two cells called spermatids. The spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a flagellum, becoming sperm cells. Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis."}
{"question": "What kind of viscosity is found in long-chain hydrocarbons?", "distractor3": "intense viscosity", "distractor1": "increased viscosity", "distractor2": "low viscosity", "correct_answer": "highly viscous", "support": "Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become \u201ctangled\u201d with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length. Due to a combination of these two effects, long-chain hydrocarbons (such as motor oils) are highly viscous."}
{"question": "Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in this?", "distractor3": "occasional array", "distractor1": "incorrect array", "distractor2": "normal array", "correct_answer": "regular array", "support": "The lattice energy (U) of an ionic substance is defined as the energy required to dissociate the solid into gaseous ions; U can be calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. Because U depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. Lattice energies cannot be measured directly but are obtained from a thermochemical cycle called the Born\u2013Haber cycle, in which Hess\u2019s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured enthalpy of formation of the ionic compound, along with other thermochemical data. The Born\u2013Haber cycle can be used to predict which ionic compounds are likely to form. Sublimation, the conversion of a solid directly to a gas, has an accompanying enthalpy change called the enthalpy of sublimation."}

{"question": "Paracrine signals move by what method through the extracellular matrix?", "distractor3": "transfusion", "distractor1": "osmosis", "distractor2": "deposition", "correct_answer": "diffusion", "support": "Paracrine Signaling Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove! When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal."}

{"question": "By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the united states will be 60 years of age or older. the cdc estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of this?", "distractor3": "blood vessels", "distractor1": "respiratory system", "distractor2": "cardiovascular system", "correct_answer": "immune system", "support": "Immune System By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the United States will be 60 years of age or older. The CDC estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. To treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35\u201345 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one\u2019s life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of na\u00efve T cells high. The ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones."}
{"question": "Most insects reproduce quickly and through what type of reproduction?", "distractor3": "asexual reproduction", "distractor1": "spores", "distractor2": "photosynthesis", "correct_answer": "sexual reproduction", "support": "Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time. With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can quickly adjust to environmental changes. The female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food. In this type of reproduction, the offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects."}

Enterokinase, an enzyme located in the wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, which in turn activates chymotrypsin. These enzymes liberate the individual amino acids that are then transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across the intestinal wall into the cell. The amino acids are then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to create new proteins. When in excess, the amino acids are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. The nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated in the urine. In times of starvation, amino acids can be used as an energy source and processed through the Krebs cycle."}
{"question": "Many species of rotifers exhibit haplodiploidy, which is a method of what?", "distractor3": "respiration", "distractor1": "circulation", "distractor2": "digestion", "correct_answer": "gender determination", "support": "Rotifers are pseudocoelomates commonly found in fresh water and some salt water environments throughout the world. Figure 28.17 shows the anatomy of a rotifer belonging to class Bdelloidea. About 2,200 species of rotifers have been identified. Rotifers are dioecious organisms (having either male or female genitalia) and exhibit sexual dimorphism (males and females have different forms). Many species are parthenogenic and exhibit haplodiploidy, a method of gender determination in which a fertilized egg develops into a female and an unfertilized egg develops into a male. In many dioecious species, males are short-lived and smaller with no digestive system and a single testis."}
{"question": "What is the most abundant metal of the earth's crust?", "distractor3": "magnetite", "distractor1": "calcium", "distractor2": "copper", "correct_answer": "aluminum", "support": "Metals represent approximately 25% of the elemental makeup of the Earth's crust. The bulk of these metals, primarily aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are typically found in combined form. The most abundant metal is aluminum, which occurs almost exclusively as the ionic mineral bauxite. Very few metals actually occur naturally as pure substances. The ones that do are often referred to as precious or semi-precious metals."}

{"question": "The body cannot sustain for very long the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones associated with what stress response?", "distractor3": "sink-or-swim", "distractor1": "do-or-die", "distractor2": "fainting", "correct_answer": "fight-or-flight", "support": "Long-term Stress Response Long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response, the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells. There are two main corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis. Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume. Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing\u2019s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood. Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison\u2019s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and low electrolyte levels in the blood."}
{"question": "What system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex?", "distractor3": "lipids system", "distractor1": "vasculature system", "distractor2": "ventrical system", "correct_answer": "vestibular system", "support": "14.2 Central Processing Sensory input to the brain enters through pathways that travel through either the spinal cord (for somatosensory input from the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon. This is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. The vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. The visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. The dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information."}

They are decomposers called saprotrophs. Fungi use enzymes to digest organic remains and then absorb the resulting organic compounds. They break down nonliving organic matter and release the nutrients into the soil. Plants can then use the nutrients and pass them on to herbivores and other consumers."}
{"question": "How do very massive stars end their lives?", "distractor3": "consumed by black hole", "distractor1": "become super novas", "distractor2": "explode", "correct_answer": "become red supergiants", "support": "A more massive star ends its life in a more dramatic way. Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces. For this reason, stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses."}
{"question": "The overall voltage of the battery is therefore the sum of ________ of the individual cells.", "distractor3": "weights", "distractor1": "currents", "distractor2": "resistances", "correct_answer": "voltages", "support": "Batteries There are two basic kinds of batteries: disposable, or primary, batteries, in which the electrode reactions are effectively irreversible and which cannot be recharged; andrechargeable, or secondary, batteries, which form an insoluble product that adheres to the electrodes. The recharging process temporarily converts a rechargeable battery from a galvanic cell to an electrolytic cell. The major difference between batteries and the galvanic cells we have previously described is that commercial batteries use solids or pastes rather than solutions as reactants to maximize the electrical output per unit mass. The use of highly concentrated or solid reactants has another beneficial effect: the concentrations of the reactants and the products do not change greatly as the battery is discharged; consequently, the output voltage remains remarkably constant during the discharge process. This behavior is in contrast to that of the Zn/Cu cell, whose output decreases logarithmically as the reaction proceeds (Figure 19.11 \"The Variation of \"). When a battery consists of more than one galvanic cell, the cells are usually connected in series\u2014that is, with the positive (+) terminal of one cell connected to the negative (\u2212) terminal of the next, and so forth. The overall voltage of the battery is therefore the sum of the voltages of the individual cells."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of bright colors on a flower's petals?", "distractor3": "to attract a mate", "distractor1": "to distract predators", "distractor2": "to absorb light", "correct_answer": "to attract pollinators", "support": "Flowers Flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central stalk. Although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. Petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. Sepals and petals together form the perianth. The sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. As illustrated in Figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. A long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. The ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. The male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel. Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther."}
{"question": "Collateral ganglia controls organs in which cavity in the body?", "distractor3": "cardiac", "distractor1": "cranial", "distractor2": "pelvic", "correct_answer": "abdominal", "support": "To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of \u201cjunctions\u201d that operate within the sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see Figure 15.3a). The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector\u2014in this case, the trachea\u2014via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. With respect to the \u201cwiring\u201d involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. The spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see Figure 15.3b). The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3c). The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2)."}

The process begins with the ovarian stem cells, or oogonia (Figure 27.11). Oogonia are formed during fetal development, and divide via mitosis, much like spermatogonia in the testis. These primary oocytes are then arrested in this stage of meiosis I, only to resume it years later, beginning at puberty and continuing until the woman is near menopause (the cessation of a woman\u2019s reproductive functions). The number of primary oocytes present in the ovaries declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause. The initiation of ovulation\u2014the release of an oocyte from the ovary\u2014marks the transition from puberty into reproductive maturity for women. Just prior to ovulation, a surge of luteinizing hormone triggers the resumption of meiosis in a primary oocyte. This initiates the transition from primary to secondary oocyte. However, as you can see in Figure 27.11, this cell division does not result in two identical cells. Instead, the cytoplasm is divided unequally, and one daughter cell is much larger than the other. Therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives."}

First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae."}

Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants."}

The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where they are used to allow growth and repair. Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits: \u2022 Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots.

{"question": "What is another term for blood clotting?", "distractor3": "differentiation", "distractor1": "adulation", "distractor2": "oxidation", "correct_answer": "coagulation", "support": "Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting, or coagulation. As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved. The direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during childbirth, as illustrated in Figure 33.21. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the uterus. Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth."}

{"question": "What phenomenon, which is most important in small populations, occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation?", "distractor3": "genetic code", "distractor1": "genetic DNA", "distractor2": "genetic mutation", "correct_answer": "genetic drift", "support": "Genetic drift is most important in small populations. Genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. Alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. If one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes\u2014a tenth of the population\u2019s gene pool\u2014will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population\u2019s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. In a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. It is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. There might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. A coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). The frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all A or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. This simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. The effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. Its effect is also greater on an allele with a frequency far from one half. Drift will influence every allele, even those that are being naturally selected."}

What is special about this element that makes diamond so hard? Bonds. Four is the greatest number of bonds that is commonly made by atoms, so C atoms maximize their interactions with other atoms. This threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. Breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. Also, the bonds are moderately strong. Not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. There are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. Silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. How do atoms make compounds? These joins are called chemical bonds. But how do atoms join together? Before we discuss how electrons interact, we need to introduce a tool to simply illustrate electrons in an atom."}

Reciprocal crosses generated identical F1 and F2 offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events. Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses. The use of the word \u201cand\u201d suggests the appropriate application of the product rule. To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual probabilities together. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule."}

The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced. This act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along (Figure 23.5). Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head."}

Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. In some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals. In scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body. Neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia. These animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle."}
{"question": "Calcium ion is an example of what kind of messenger?", "distractor3": "first", "distractor1": "third", "distractor2": "fourth", "correct_answer": "second", "support": "Second Messengers Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells."}
{"question": "What is the process by which water moves through semi-permeable membranes from one part of the body to another?", "distractor3": "mitosis", "distractor1": "diffusion", "distractor2": "electrolysis", "correct_answer": "osmosis", "support": "26.1 | Body Fluids and Fluid Compartments By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Explain the importance of water in the body \u2022 Contrast the composition of the intracellular fluid with that of the extracellular fluid \u2022 Explain the importance of protein channels in the movement of solutes \u2022 Identify the causes and symptoms of edema The chemical reactions of life take place in aqueous solutions. The dissolved substances in a solution are called solutes. In the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins\u2014including those that transport lipids, carbohydrates, and, very importantly, electrolytes. For instance, sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) are often referred to as electrolytes. Osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. As a result, water will move into and out of cells and tissues, depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there. An appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function."}

{"question": "Which cavity, filled with lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the pericardium?", "distractor3": "thoracic cavity", "distractor1": "cranial cavity", "distractor2": "oral cavity", "correct_answer": "pericardial cavity", "support": "and is part of the heart wall. In most organs within the body, visceral serous membranes such as the epicardium are microscopic. However, in the case of the heart, it is not a microscopic layer but rather a macroscopic layer, consisting of a simple squamous epithelium called a mesothelium, reinforced with loose, irregular, or areolar connective tissue that attaches to the pericardium. This mesothelium secretes the lubricating serous fluid that fills the pericardial cavity and reduces friction as the heart contracts. Figure 19.5 illustrates the pericardial membrane and the layers of the heart."}
{"question": "In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called what?", "distractor3": "metabolic circulation", "distractor1": "systemic circulation", "distractor2": "sensory circulation", "correct_answer": "pulmonary circulation", "support": "In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart\u2019s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in Figure 40.4c. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. Two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure 40.4d. The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution."}

Microbiologists must carry out their lab work using the aseptic technique to prevent microbial contamination of themselves, contamination of the environment they are working in, including work surfaces or equipment, and contamination of the sample they are working on. Bacteria live on just about every surface on Earth, so if a scientist wants to grow a particular type of bacterium in the lab, he or she needs to be able to sterilize their equipment to prevent contamination by other bacteria or microorganisms. The aseptic technique is also used in medicine, where it is important to keep the human body free of contamination."}
{"question": "Connecting a magnesium rod to an underground steel pipeline protects the pipeline from corrosion. because magnesium (e\u00b0 = \u22122.37 v) is much more easily oxidized than iron (e\u00b0 = \u22120.45 v), the mg rod acts as the anode in a what?", "distractor3": "voltaic cell", "distractor1": "anode cell", "distractor2": "stimulation cell", "correct_answer": "galvanic cell", "support": "Connecting a magnesium rod to an underground steel pipeline protects the pipeline from corrosion. The pipeline is therefore forced to act as the cathode at which oxygen is reduced. The soil between the anode and the cathode acts as a salt bridge that completes the electrical circuit and maintains electrical neutrality. Simultaneously, cations in the soil, such as H+ or NH4+, diffuse toward the cathode, where they replenish the protons that are consumed as oxygen is reduced. A similar strategy uses many miles of somewhat less reactive zinc wire to protect the Alaska oil pipeline."}

The cell wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators. Fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol, a steroid molecule that functions like the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. Some fungi are dimorphic because they can go from being unicellular to multicellular depending on environmental conditions. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. They display two distinct morphological stages: vegetative and reproductive. The vegetative stage is characterized by a tangle of slender thread-like structures called hyphae (singular, hypha), whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. A mass of hyphae is called a mycelium (Figure 13.22). It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even in or on living tissue. Although individual hypha must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large with some species truly being \u201cthe fungus humongous. \u201d The giant Armillaria ostoyae (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth, spreading across over 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old."}

More than 62,000 vertebrate species have been identified. The best-known extinct vertebrates are the dinosaurs, a unique group of reptiles, which reached sizes not seen before or after in terrestrial animals. They were the dominant terrestrial animals for 150 million years, until they died out in a mass extinction near the end of the Cretaceous period. Currently, a number of vertebrate species face extinction primarily due to habitat loss and pollution. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, more than 6,000 vertebrate species are classified as threatened. Amphibians and mammals are the classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species, with 29 percent of all amphibians and 21 percent of all mammals classified as threatened. For example, the Biodiversity Action Plan is an international program, ratified by 188 countries, which is designed to protect species and habitats."}

{"question": "Unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar are the four basic types of what?", "distractor3": "electrons", "distractor1": "ions", "distractor2": "protons", "correct_answer": "neurons", "support": "While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar. Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord."}

{"question": "If the dna from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately how long?", "distractor3": "one meter", "distractor1": "three meters", "distractor2": "four meters", "correct_answer": "two meters", "support": "Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 \u00b5m (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell\u2019s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. The beadlike, histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in Figure 10.3)."}

{"question": "What particles ancient greeks propose that matter consists of ?", "distractor3": "ether", "distractor1": "ions", "distractor2": "molecules", "correct_answer": "atoms", "support": "Summary 2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson\u2019s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge\u2014the charge of an electron. Rutherford\u2019s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 \u00d7 10\u221224 g. Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1\u2212 and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number."}
{"question": "Repolarization occurs when the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting what?", "distractor3": "tension", "distractor1": "charge", "distractor2": "resistance", "correct_answer": "voltage", "support": "These channels are specific for the potassium ion. As K+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane potential. Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the K+ channels are open. Those K+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. What has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in Figure 12.23. It is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. That can also be written as a 0.1-V change. To put that value in perspective, think about a battery. An AA battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of 1.5 V, or a 9-V battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V. The change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. A battery in your remote has stored a charge that is \u201creleased\u201d when you push a button."}

{"question": "What is the dinosaur genus that's closest to modern birds?", "distractor3": "Rapter", "distractor1": "sauropods", "distractor2": "diplodocus", "correct_answer": "deinonychus", "support": "Deinonychus is the genus name of an extinct dinosaur that is considered to be one of the closest non-bird relatives of modern birds. It lived about 110 million years ago in what is now North America. For example, it had feathers and wings. It also had strong legs with clawed feet, similar to modern raptors. Its respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems were similar to those of birds as well. The location of fossilized eggs near Deinonychus fossils suggests that it may have brooded its eggs. On the other hand, Deinonychus retained a number of reptile-like traits, such as jaws with teeth and hands with claws at the tips of its wings."}

For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals. To achieve the outcome of identical daughter cells, some steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. Mitosis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus or multiple chromosomes. This type of cell division is called binary fission."}

{"question": "In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at what?", "distractor3": "default", "distractor1": "rest", "distractor2": "scale", "correct_answer": "resonance", "support": "It is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in Figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. The message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. Little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. Conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car\u2019s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. When you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station\u2019s broadcast (driving) frequency. The more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). Speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car\u2019s suspension system is not immune to resonance. In spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. Figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. The diaphragm and chest wall drive the oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. The system is critically damped and the muscular diaphragm oscillates at the resonant value for the system, making it highly efficient."}

As you will learn in Section 20.5 \"Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism\" through Section 20.7 \"Stage II of Protein Catabolism\", there are specific metabolic pathways\u2014which are different for carbohydrates, triglycerides, and proteins\u2014that break down the products of stage I of catabolism (monosaccharides, fatty acids, and amino acids) to produce a common end product, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in stage II of catabolism. Acetyl-CoA is shown in Figure 20.10 \"The Structure of Acetyl-Coenzyme A (AcetylCoA)\". The acetyl unit, derived (as we will see) from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, is attached to coenzyme A, making the acetyl unit more reactive. Acetyl-CoA is used in a myriad of biochemical pathways. Most importantly for energy generation, it may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, if energy is needed and oxygen is available.

{"question": "What is released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse?", "distractor3": "semen", "distractor1": "urine", "distractor2": "blood", "correct_answer": "vaginal secretions", "support": "The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. Sexual Response during Intercourse The sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. During the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase. During phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. In the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours."}

{"question": "Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a what?", "distractor3": "tissue", "distractor1": "gravity", "distractor2": "gases", "correct_answer": "fluid", "support": "14.4 Heat Transfer Methods Equally as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which this occurs. Heat transfer may occur rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. We can control rates of heat transfer by choosing materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). So many processes involve heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods: 1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of the Earth by the Sun."}

The pituitary gland secretes growth hormone (GH), which, as its name implies, controls bone growth in several ways. It triggers chondrocyte proliferation in epiphyseal plates, resulting in the increasing length of long bones. GH is not alone in stimulating bone growth and maintaining osseous tissue. Thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland promotes osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone matrix. During puberty, the sex hormones (estrogen in girls, testosterone in boys) also come into play. Additionally, calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is produced by the kidneys and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the digestive tract."}
{"question": "We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of these?", "distractor3": "electron bonds", "distractor1": "isotopes", "distractor2": "negative charges", "correct_answer": "actual charges", "support": "Calculating Formal Charge The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure. Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows: formal charge = # valence shell electrons (free atom) \u2212 # lone pair electrons \u2212 1 # bonding electrons 2 We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges."}
{"question": "The amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for which clade?", "distractor3": "avian", "distractor1": "trichina", "distractor2": "xerophyte", "correct_answer": "amniota", "support": "What is the largest clade in this diagram? Scientists use the phrase \u201cdescent with modification\u201d because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group. Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait. New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits. With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat). If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait. Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree. The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative. The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used. Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this group. These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees."}

{"question": "The development of the respiratory system in the fetus begins at about?", "distractor3": "4 days", "distractor1": "2 weeks", "distractor2": "4 months", "correct_answer": "4 weeks", "support": "22.7 Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System The development of the respiratory system in the fetus begins at about 4 weeks and continues into childhood. Ectodermal tissue in the anterior portion of the head region invaginates posteriorly, forming olfactory pits, which ultimately fuse with endodermal tissue of the early pharynx. At about this same time, an protrusion of endodermal tissue extends anteriorly from the foregut, producing a lung bud, which continues to elongate until it forms the laryngotracheal bud. The proximal portion of this structure will mature into the trachea, whereas the bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial buds. Development progresses after week 16 as respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive vascularization occurs. Alveolar type I cells also begin to take shape. Type II pulmonary cells develop and begin to produce small amounts of surfactant. As the fetus grows, the respiratory system continues to expand as more alveoli develop and more surfactant is produced. At birth, compression of the thoracic cavity forces much of the fluid in the lungs to be expelled. The first inhalation inflates the lungs."}

{"question": "If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, what is released in the atmosphere?", "distractor3": "electricity", "distractor1": "oxygen", "distractor2": "hydrogen", "correct_answer": "heat", "support": "Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. More condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher."}
{"question": "How many types of molecular orbitals can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms?", "distractor3": "ten", "distractor1": "three", "distractor2": "six", "correct_answer": "two", "support": "The in-phase combination produces a lower energy \u03c3s molecular orbital (read as \"sigma-s\") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy molecular orbital (read as \"sigma-s-star\") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a \u03c3s orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the \u03c3*s orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill higher-energy atomic orbitals."}

Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty acids and glycerol. Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may lead to protein denaturation and a loss of function."}
{"question": "In photosynthesis, what process involving carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata?", "distractor3": "transpiration", "distractor1": "osmosis", "distractor2": "fertilization", "correct_answer": "gas exchange", "support": "Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids."}

{"question": "What is the conversion of a solid to a gas called?", "distractor3": "education", "distractor1": "speciation", "distractor2": "amplification", "correct_answer": "sublimation", "support": "(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout."}
{"question": "Which form of dialysis has a patient\u2019s blood pass through a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine?", "distractor3": "arterial dialysis", "distractor1": "peritoneal dialysis", "distractor2": "limbic dialysis", "correct_answer": "hemodialysis", "support": "In one form of dialysis, called hemodialysis, a patient\u2019s blood is passed though a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine (also called adialysis machine). A section of tubing composed of a semipermeable membrane is immersed in a solution of sterile water, glucose, amino acids, and certain electrolytes. The osmotic pressure of the blood forces waste molecules and excess water through the membrane into the sterile solution. Red and white blood cells are too large to pass through the membrane, so they remain in the blood. After being cleansed in this way, the blood is returned to the body. Dialysis is a continuous process, as the osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time. Although some patients have been on dialysis for 30 or more years, dialysis is always a temporary solution because waste materials are constantly building up in the bloodstream. A more permanent solution is a kidney transplant. If solutions of different osmolarity exist on either side of the cells, solvent (water) may pass into or out of the cells, sometimes with disastrous results. The cells swell up as water enters them, disrupting cellular activity and eventually causing the cells to burst. If red blood cells are placed in ahypertonic solution, meaning one having a higher osmolarity than exists inside the cells, water leaves the cells to dilute the external solution, and the red blood cells shrivel and die. Only if red blood cells are placed inisotonic solutions that have the same osmolarity as exists inside the cells are they unaffected by negative effects of osmotic pressure. Glucose solutions of about 0.31 M, or sodium chloride solutions of about 0.16 M, are isotonic with blood plasma."}

{"question": "Salts that are neither acidic nor basic do not affect what property of the solution when dissolved in water?", "distractor3": "density", "distractor1": "homeostasis", "distractor2": "saturation", "correct_answer": "ph", "support": "The simplest situation is a salt formed by combining a strong acid and a strong base. These salts are neither acidic nor basic, so they do not affect the pH of the solution when dissolved in water. If we were to dissolve NaNO 3 in water, it would dissociate into Na + and NO 3 - ions. Neither ion is a strong enough acid or base to cause any noticeable proton transfers, so the pH of the pure water is not altered."}
{"question": "What protects the pollen of seed plants and spores of seedless plants?", "distractor3": "chlorophyll", "distractor1": "cystosol", "distractor2": "cocklebur", "correct_answer": "sporopollenin", "support": "The spores of seedless plants and the pollen of seed plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin. This substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids, and gives most pollen its yellow color. Its toughness explains the existence of well-preserved fossils of pollen. Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants; however, the green algae Coleochaetes is now known to form spores that contain sporopollenin. Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides nutrition, and in seed plants, the embryo is also protected as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte."}
{"question": "What are groups of stars called that are smaller than a galaxy?", "distractor3": "constellations", "distractor1": "Milky Way", "distractor2": "nebuli", "correct_answer": "star clusters", "support": "Star clusters are groups of stars smaller than a galaxy. There are two main types, open clusters and globular clusters. The Jewel Box, shown in Figure below , is an open cluster. Open clusters tend to be blue in color, and often contain glowing gas and dust. The stars in an open cluster are young stars that all formed from the same nebula."}
{"question": "Expansion of a gas into a vacuum is irreversible because the external pressure is measurably less than the internal pressure of the gas, and no states of what exist?", "distractor3": "composition", "distractor1": "balance", "distractor2": "liquid", "correct_answer": "equilibrium", "support": "can continue indefinitely. No equilibrium states exist, and the gas expands irreversibly. Because work done during the expansion of a gas depends on the opposing external pressure (w = Pext\u0394V), work done in a reversible process is always equal to or greater than work done in a corresponding irreversible process: wrev \u2265 wirrev. Whether a process is reversible or irreversible, \u0394E = q + w. Because E is a state function, the magnitude of \u0394E does not depend on reversibility and is independent of the path taken. So Equation 18.14."}
{"question": "One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action\u2014the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or called this?", "distractor3": "pressure tube", "distractor1": "melting tube", "distractor2": "cohesive tube", "correct_answer": "capillary tube", "support": "One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action\u2014the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube. Capillary Action The tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action. If a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown in Figure 11.34, capillary action will raise or suppress the liquid inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. The actual effect depends on the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus, the contact angle \u03b8 given in the table. If \u03b8 is less than 90\u00ba , then the fluid will be raised; if \u03b8 is greater than 90\u00ba , it will be suppressed. Mercury, for example, has a very large surface tension and a large contact angle with glass. The curved surface of a fluid in a tube is called a meniscus. The tendency of surface tension is always to reduce the surface area. Surface tension thus flattens the curved liquid surface in a capillary tube."}
{"question": "What kind of weather can you expect if a center of low pressure is moving your way?", "distractor3": "sunny", "distractor1": "rain", "distractor2": "rough", "correct_answer": "stormy", "support": "That\u2019s because it\u2019s very complex and many factors are involved. Slight changes in even one factor can cause a big change in the weather. Still, certain \u201crules of thumb\u201d generally apply. These \u201crules\u201d help meteorologists forecast the weather. So if a center of low pressure is moving your way, you can expect a storm."}

The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent."}
{"question": "On how many of the continents do birds live and breed?", "distractor3": "eight", "distractor1": "three", "distractor2": "four", "correct_answer": "seven", "support": "They occupy a wide range of ecological positions. Raptors are carnivores; aquatic birds eat fish or water plants; and perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar. Some birds are pollinators that co-evolved with plants. Human actions have caused the extinction of hundreds of species of birds, and some 1,200 species are threatened with extinction today."}
{"question": "The hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of what?", "distractor3": "ions", "distractor1": "density", "distractor2": "protons", "correct_answer": "electrons", "support": "In the course of this reaction, electrons are shifted away from each hydrogen atom and towards the oxygen atom. Even though the loss is not complete enough to form ions, the hydrogen atoms in water have less electron density near them than they did in the H 2 molecule. The oxygen is reduced because it undergoes a partial gain of electrons. The oxygen atom in water has greater electron density near it than they did in the O 2 molecule."}
{"question": "Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. a change that releases heat is called what?", "distractor3": "biochemical process", "distractor1": "magnetic process", "distractor2": "oxidized process", "correct_answer": "exothermic process", "support": "A change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process\u2014this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch\u2019s flame (Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold."}
{"question": "What two types of tissue compose most of the non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast?", "distractor3": "scar and collagenous", "distractor1": "intestine and collagenous", "distractor2": "silicone and collagenous", "correct_answer": "adipose and collagenous", "support": "Structure of the Lactating Breast Mammary glands are modified sweat glands. The non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast is composed primarily of adipose and collagenous tissue, with mammary glands making up a very minor proportion of breast volume. The mammary gland is composed of milk-transporting lactiferous ducts, which expand and branch extensively during pregnancy in response to estrogen, growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin. Moreover, in response to progesterone, clusters of breast alveoli bud from the ducts and expand outward toward the chest wall. Breast alveoli are balloon-like structures lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells, or lactocytes, that are surrounded by a net of contractile myoepithelial cells. Milk is secreted from the lactocytes, fills the alveoli, and is squeezed into the ducts. They secrete oil to cleanse the nipple opening and prevent chapping and cracking of the nipple during breastfeeding."}
{"question": "Control of the body can be somatic or autonomic, offering one way to divide what organ system by function?", "distractor3": "central system", "distractor1": "cardiovascular system", "distractor2": "circulatory system", "correct_answer": "nervous system", "support": "Functional Divisions of the Nervous System The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of its functions, but anatomical divisions and functional divisions are different. The problem with trying to fit functional differences into anatomical divisions is that sometimes the same structure can be part of several functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are either used for the conscious perception of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are processed through the hypothalamus. There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous system are sensation, integration, and response. There is also a region of the peripheral nervous system that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm of autonomic control related to gastrointestinal functions."}

Amino acids are the fundamental building blocks of proteins, a major biological component. Proteins are a necessary part of the diet; meat, eggs, and certain vegetables such as beans and soy are good sources of protein and amino acids. However, not all of them must be obtained from the diet. The body can synthesize 12 amino acids. The other 8 mustbe obtained from the diet. Daily requirements range from 4 mg per kilogram of body weight for tryptophan to 40 mg per kilogram of body weight for leucine. Infants and children need a greater mass per kg of body weight to support their growing bodies; also, the number of amino acids that are considered essential for infants and children is greater than for adults due to the greater protein synthesis associated with growth. Because of the existence of essential amino acids, a diet that is properly balanced in protein is necessary. Rice and beans, a very popular food dish Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books."}
{"question": "The leaves of what plant genus are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant and is similar to amphetamines?", "distractor3": "additive", "distractor1": "Stimulant", "distractor2": "dietary", "correct_answer": "ephedra", "support": "The genus Ephedra is represented in North America in dry areas of the southwestern United States and Mexico (Figure 14.23). Ephedra\u2019s small, scale-like leaves are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant. Because ephedrine is similar to amphetamines, both in chemical structure and neurological effects, its use is restricted to prescription drugs. Like angiosperms, but unlike other gymnosperms, all gnetophytes possess vessel elements in their xylem."}
{"question": "The simplest organic compounds are known as what?", "distractor3": "nucleotides", "distractor1": "amino acids", "distractor2": "carbohydrates", "correct_answer": "hydrocarbons", "support": "Opening Essay Hydrocarbons are the simplest organic compounds, but they have interesting physiological effects. These effects depend on the size of the hydrocarbon molecules and where on or in the body they are applied. Alkanes of low molar mass\u2014those with from 1 to approximately 10 or so carbon atoms\u2014are gases or light liquids that act as anesthetics. Swallowed, liquid alkanes do little harm while in the stomach. In the lungs, however, they cause \u201cchemical\u201d pneumonia by dissolving fatlike molecules from cell membranes in the tiny air sacs (alveoli). The lungs become unable to expel fluids, just as in pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses. People who swallow gasoline or other liquid alkane mixtures should not be made to vomit, as this would increase the chance of getting alkanes into the lungs. Liquid alkanes with approximately 5\u201316 carbon atoms per molecule wash away natural skin oils and cause drying and chapping of the skin, while heavier liquid alkanes (those with approximately 17 or more carbon atoms per molecule) act as emollients (skin softeners). Such alkane mixtures as mineral oil and petroleum jelly can be applied as a protective film."}
{"question": "All biochemical molecules have oxygen, carbon, and what other element?", "distractor3": "calcium", "distractor1": "helium", "distractor2": "nitrogen", "correct_answer": "hydrogen", "support": "All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon.

Its shape causes the ship to displace much more water than the ball. As a result, the buoyant force is greater than the force of gravity acting on the ship, so the ship floats."}
{"question": "Practitioners of what thought all matter was composed of different proportions of four basic elements, and that if you changed the proportions of these elements, you could change the substance itself?", "distractor3": "phrenology", "distractor1": "chemistry", "distractor2": "biology", "correct_answer": "alchemy", "support": "Alchemy was a somewhat mystical and secretive approach to learning how to manipulate matter. Practitioners, called alchemists, thought that all matter was composed of different proportions of the four basic elements\u2014fire, water, earth, and air\u2014and believed that if you changed the relative proportions of these elements in a substance, you could change the substance. The long-standing attempts to \u201ctransmute\u201d common metals into gold represented one goal of alchemy. Alchemists used symbols to represent substances, some of which are shown in the accompanying figure. This was not done to better communicate ideas, as chemists do today, but to maintain the secrecy of alchemical knowledge, keeping others from sharing in it."}

{"question": "What is added to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution to achieve a particular concentration?", "distractor3": "pigment", "distractor1": "water", "distractor2": "yeast", "correct_answer": "solvent", "support": "Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is appropriate for their application. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory reagents (Figure 3.17)."}
{"question": "Because optics fibers are thin, entering light may strike the inside surface at greater than the critical angle, requiring attention to what?", "distractor3": "wavelength", "distractor1": "reflective point", "distractor2": "electromagnetic index", "correct_answer": "refractive index", "support": "Fiber Optics: Endoscopes to Telephones Fiber optics is one application of total internal reflection that is in wide use. In communications, it is used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (See Figure 25.14. ) The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is easily satisfied by coating the outside of the fiber with a material having an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal refraction."}

These forests gave rise to the extensive coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name. In seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte became the dominant phase of the lifecycle. Modern-day seedless vascular plants include club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns. Club Mosses The club mosses, or Lycophyta, are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants. They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous period, growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests. Today\u2019s club mosses are diminutive, evergreen plants consisting of a stem (which may be branched) and small leaves called microphylls (Figure 14.13). The division Lycophyta consists of close to 1,000 species, including quillworts (Isoetales), club mosses (Lycopodiales), and spike mosses (Selaginellales): none of which is a true moss."}

It was once the most common bird in North America, but overhunting and habitat destruction led to its extinction in the 1800s. Habitat destruction and use of the pesticide DDT explain the recent extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow. This native Florida bird was declared extinct in 1990."}
{"question": "What is the process called where nitrogen is repeatedly recycled through the biosphere?", "distractor3": "nitrogen path", "distractor1": "ammonia cycle", "distractor2": "water cycle", "correct_answer": "nitrogen cycle", "support": "Like water and carbon, nitrogen is also repeatedly recycled through the biosphere. This process is called the nitrogen cycle . The air that we breathe is mostly nitrogen gas (N 2 ), but, unfortunately, animals and plants cannot use the nitrogen when it is a gas. In fact, plants often die from a lack of nitrogen even through they are surrounded by plenty of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas (N 2 ) has two nitrogen atoms connected by a very strong triple bond. Most plants and animals cannot use the nitrogen in nitrogen gas because they cannot break that triple bond."}

{"question": "What model describing atomic structure is often referred to as a planetary model?", "distractor3": "Pascal model", "distractor1": "Newton's model", "distractor2": "kinetic model", "correct_answer": "bohr model", "support": "According to the Bohr model, often referred to as a planetary model , the electrons encircle the nucleus of the atom in specific allowable paths called orbits. The ground state of the hydrogen atom, where its energy is lowest, is when the electron is in the orbit that is closest to the nucleus. The orbits that are further from the nucleus are all of successively greater energy. The electron is not allowed to occupy any of the spaces in between the orbits. An everyday analogy to the Bohr model is the rungs of a ladder. Moving up the ladder increases your potential energy, while moving down the ladder decreases your energy."}

Some reactions take place in the atmosphere, such as the combustion of fossil fuels. Others occur in solution, like the reactions responsible for photosynthesis or the reactions that break down our food to give us energy. Chemical reactions can take place in a variety of environments. Reactions happen on the sea floor, in our cells, and in the upper atmosphere. As we look at chemical reactions, we notice some commonalities and trends. When we studied the elements, we saw characteristics that allowed us to categorize them by family. Some reactions produce heat, while others consume it. Some reactions are spontaneous, while others are not. The products of chemical reactions tell us a lot about the chemistry of the process. In the above video, we see mercury(II) oxide decomposing into elemental mercury and oxygen gas. Decomposition was one of the first reaction types to be identified by chemists. Decomposition is one type of reaction you'll learn about in this lesson."}
{"question": "Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside what?", "distractor3": "brain cell", "distractor1": "sponsor cell", "distractor2": "anchor cell", "correct_answer": "host cell", "support": "Some prokaryotes, however, cannot grow in a laboratory setting. In fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are unculturable. For the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them; they have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell. In other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could be cultured previously. Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival. Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable. Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a process called amplification."}

{"question": "What term means the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms?", "distractor3": "ceramics", "distractor1": "metamorphisis", "distractor2": "introversion", "correct_answer": "metallurgy", "support": "Consequently, almost all metallic elements must be isolated from metal oxide or metal sulfide ores. Metallurgy is the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. Many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% Cu by mass are considered commercially useful. Next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: settling and flotation, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; pyrometallurgy, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and hydrometallurgy, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. Other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. For example, crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as lodestone) was used to make the first compasses in China during the first century BC. If a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the Fe3O4 particles are attracted to the poles of the magnet, allowing them to be easily separated from other minerals."}

{"question": "The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called what?", "distractor3": "protein", "distractor1": "rna", "distractor2": "dna", "correct_answer": "genetic code", "support": "The Genetic Code To summarize what we know to this point, the cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters. The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic code. Given the different numbers of \u201cletters\u201d in the mRNA and protein \u201calphabets,\u201d combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids."}
{"question": "Traditionally, what preventative measure used weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the immune system?", "distractor3": "pathogen", "distractor1": "infection", "distractor2": "assimilation", "correct_answer": "vaccine", "support": "Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the immune system. Modern techniques use specific genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors and mass-produced in bacteria to make large quantities of specific substances to stimulate the immune system. The substance is then used as a vaccine. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells. The fungal cells have typically been genetically modified to improve the yields of the antibiotic compound. Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of the human hormone insulin in E. coli as early as 1978. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders."}

{"question": "A sealed, vacuum-insulated reaction flask approximates what condition, in which neither matter nor heat can be exchanged between system and surroundings?", "distractor3": "sure system", "distractor1": "shared system", "distractor2": "changing system", "correct_answer": "isolated system", "support": "In an open system , both matter and heat can be freely exchanged between the reaction container (the system) and the surroundings. An example would be an open beaker, where any gaseous materials or vaporized molecules are free to leave the system and float off into the atmosphere. In a closed system , matter cannot enter or leave, but heat can flow between the system and surroundings. Finally, a situation in which neither matter nor heat can be exchanged between system and surroundings is referred to as an isolated system . Although truly isolated systems are not really possible, a sealed, vacuum-insulated reaction flask would come very close."}
{"question": "A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and this?", "distractor3": "layer", "distractor1": "tendon", "distractor2": "electron", "correct_answer": "capillary", "support": "Slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical: If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. Normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (Figure 20.6). If all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. This creates what is known as a vascular shunt. In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system. Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular, pulsating flow."}
{"question": "What term always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the direction of the velocity and always reduces speed, unlike negative acceleration?", "distractor3": "calibration", "distractor1": "progression", "distractor2": "extraction", "correct_answer": "deceleration", "support": "Misconception Alert: Deceleration vs. Negative Acceleration Deceleration always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the direction of the velocity. Deceleration always reduces speed. Negative acceleration, however, is acceleration in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate system. Negative acceleration may or may not be deceleration, and deceleration may or may not be considered negative acceleration."}
{"question": "Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides are types of what kind of macromolecule?", "distractor3": "nutrients", "distractor1": "glucose", "distractor2": "protein", "correct_answer": "carbohydrate", "support": "Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. The long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell."}
{"question": "What action do particles of the same charge do to each other?", "distractor3": "pull", "distractor1": "propagate", "distractor2": "destroy", "correct_answer": "repel", "support": "Every particle in nature has an antimatter counterpart, although some particles, like the photon, are their own antiparticles. When a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in Figure 33.13. Certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live 0 \u22128 correspondingly short lives. For example, the neutral pion \u03c0 is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10 shorter than + \u2212 \u03c0 and \u03c0 , which are each other\u2019s antiparticles. Without exception, nature is symmetric\u2014all particles have antimatter counterparts. For example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. Antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at CERN, too. It is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. However, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. It is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. At any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. But this knowledge does raise another question\u2014why is there such a predominance of matter and so little antimatter?"}
{"question": "A cold front is formed when a cold air mass runs into what?", "distractor3": "dry air mass", "distractor1": "hurricane", "distractor2": "cool air mass", "correct_answer": "warm air mass", "support": "A cold front forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ( Figure below ). So the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a cold front."}
{"question": "When compared to anaerobic respiration, what does aerobic respiration release more of?", "distractor3": "pressure", "distractor1": "heat", "distractor2": "carbon dioxide", "correct_answer": "energy", "support": "A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration."}
{"question": "As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within what bone structure?", "distractor3": "chest", "distractor1": "skeleton", "distractor2": "spine", "correct_answer": "skull", "support": "Because the cerebrum fits into this space, it takes on a C-shaped formation, through the frontal, parietal, occipital, and finally temporal regions. The space within the telencephalon is stretched into this same C-shape. The two ventricles are in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles. The interventricular foramina connect the frontal region of the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. The two thalami touch in the center in most brains as the massa intermedia, which is surrounded by the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct opens just inferior to the epithalamus and passes through the midbrain. The tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roof and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. The floor of the fourth ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum of the midbrain). The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord. The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. The single median aperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around the outside of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called a choroid plexus. Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system) surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF. It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes."}

Because weight measures force, the SI unit for weight is the newton (N) . On Earth, a mass of 1 kilogram has a weight of about 10 newtons because of the pull of Earth\u2019s gravity On the moon, which has less gravity, the same mass would weigh less. Weight is measured with a scale, like the spring scale in Figure below ."}
{"question": "Recent evidence indicates some of what type of cells remain within the heart, continuing to divide and potentially replace dead cells?", "distractor3": "dendritic cells", "distractor1": "osteoclast cells", "distractor2": "human cells", "correct_answer": "stem cells", "support": "Repair and Replacement Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat."}
{"question": "About what percentage of the earth's water is fresh water?", "distractor3": "thirty percent", "distractor1": "two percent", "distractor2": "nine percent", "correct_answer": "three percent", "support": "Of all the water on Earth, about two percent is stored underground in spaces between rocks. A fraction of a percent exists in the air as water vapor, clouds, or precipitation. So where is most of Earth\u2019s water? Of water on Earth\u2019s surface, 97 percent is salt water, mainly in the ocean. Only 3 percent is fresh water . Most of the fresh water is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining fresh water occurs in rivers, lakes, and other fresh water features."}
{"question": "What is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food, and involves measuring biomass in terrestrial environments?", "distractor3": "trophic level total", "distractor1": "food chain", "distractor2": "decomposition energy", "correct_answer": "net primary productivity", "support": "Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary productivity). This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass. Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. Conversely, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food."}
{"question": "Twenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature what?", "distractor3": "zygote", "distractor1": "spermatozoa", "distractor2": "fetus", "correct_answer": "oocyte", "support": "When fertilized (at conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18). The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo. Pregnancy tests determine the level of \u03b2-HCG in urine or serum."}
{"question": "Oxygen is combined with what to form water?", "distractor3": "carbon", "distractor1": "glucose", "distractor2": "helium", "correct_answer": "hydrogen", "support": "The glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. While water is broken down to form oxygen during photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen to form water. While photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration. In our cells, oxygen allows cellular respiration to proceed. Cellular respiration works best in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP would be produced."}

{"question": "Any nucleus that is unstable and decays spontaneously is said to be what?", "distractor3": "magnetic", "distractor1": "neutral", "distractor2": "dull", "correct_answer": "radioactive", "support": "For example, in a typical terrestrial sample of oxygen, 99.76% of the O atoms is oxygen-16, 0.20% is oxygen-18, and 0.04% is oxygen-17. Any nucleus that is unstable and decays spontaneously is said to be radioactive, emitting subatomic particles and electromagnetic radiation. The emissions are collectively called radioactivity and can be measured. Isotopes that emit radiation are called radioisotopes. As you learned in Chapter 14 \"Chemical Kinetics\", the rate at which radioactive decay occurs is characteristic of the isotope and is generally reported as a half-life (t1/2), the amount of time required for half of the initial number of nuclei present to decay in a first-order reaction. (For more information on half-life, seeChapter 14 \"Chemical Kinetics\", Section 14.5 \"Half-Lives and Radioactive Decay Kinetics\". ) An isotope\u2019s half-life can range from fractions of a second to billions of years and, among other applications, can be used to measure the age of ancient objects."}

They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, like lichens. Fungi are not obvious in the way that large animals or tall trees are. Yet, like bacteria, they are major decomposers of nature. Importance to Ecosystems Food webs would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter and fungi are key participants in this process. Decomposition allows for cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the environment so they are available to living things, rather than being trapped in dead organisms. Fungi are particularly important because they have evolved enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin, components of plant cell walls that few other organisms are able to digest, releasing their carbon content.

Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes in order to maintain this steady state. Examples of internal conditions maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, blood calcium level. The signals that restore the normal levels are examples of negative feedback. When homeostatic mechanisms fail, the results can be unfavorable for the animal. Homeostatic mechanisms keep the body in dynamic equilibrium by constantly adjusting to the changes that the body\u2019s systems encounter. Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. The processes that maintain homeostasis of these two factors are called thermoregulation and osmoregulation."}
{"question": "What is the middle layer of connective tissue called?", "distractor3": "pollenation", "distractor1": "tendon", "distractor2": "xerophyte", "correct_answer": "perimysium", "support": "Inside each skeletal muscle, muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles, each called a fascicle, by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber. These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue. The tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon, and then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton. In other places, the mysia may fuse with a broad, tendon-like sheet called an aponeurosis, or to fascia, the connective tissue between skin and bones. The broad sheet of connective tissue in the lower back that the latissimus dorsi muscles (the \u201clats\u201d) fuse into is an example of an aponeurosis. Every skeletal muscle is also richly supplied by blood vessels for nourishment, oxygen delivery, and waste removal. In addition, every muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is supplied by the axon branch of a somatic motor neuron, which signals the fiber to contract. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, the only way to functionally contract a skeletal muscle is through signaling from the nervous system."}
{"question": "Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are what?", "distractor3": "expanding", "distractor1": "multiple", "distractor2": "simple", "correct_answer": "linear", "support": "Telomere replication Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you\u2019ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes."}

{"question": "What kind of a process is corrosion?", "distractor3": "electromagnetic", "distractor1": "electrolysis", "distractor2": "oxidation", "correct_answer": "galvanic", "support": "Note the Pattern Corrosion is a galvanic process. Under ambient conditions, the oxidation of most metals is thermodynamically spontaneous, with the notable exception of gold and platinum. Hence it is actually somewhat surprising that any metals are useful at all in Earth\u2019s moist, oxygen-rich atmosphere. For example, aluminum in soft-drink cans and airplanes is protected by a thin coating of metal oxide that forms on the surface of the metal and acts as an impenetrable barrier that prevents further destruction. Chromium, magnesium, and nickel also form protective oxide films. Stainless steels are remarkably resistant to corrosion because they usually contain a significant proportion of chromium, nickel, or both. In contrast to these metals, when iron corrodes, it forms a red-brown hydrated metal oxide (Fe2O3\u00b7xH2O), commonly known as rust, that does not provide a tight protective film (Figure 19.17 \"Rust, the Result of Corrosion of."}

Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. Animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology. Although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches. Ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. Innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to changes in the environment."}

The first of these models, exponential growth, describes theoretical populations that increase in numbers without any limits to their growth. The second model, logistic growth, introduces limits to reproductive growth that become more intense as the population size increases. Exponential Growth Charles Darwin, in developing his theory of natural selection, was influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural resources grow very rapidly; however, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. The early pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth. The best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. The important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate\u2014the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation\u2014is itself increasing; that is, the."}

{"question": "Why is closed reduction simpler than open reduction in bone repair?", "distractor3": "no treatment needed", "distractor1": "no medicine needed", "distractor2": "no pain pills needed", "correct_answer": "no surgery needed", "support": "It will heal whether or not a physician resets it in its anatomical position. If the bone is not reset correctly, the healing process will keep the bone in its deformed position. When a broken bone is manipulated and set into its natural position without surgery, the procedure is called a closed reduction. Open reduction requires surgery to expose the fracture and reset the bone. For example, a fractured diaphysis of the femur has the potential to release fat globules into the bloodstream. These can become lodged in the capillary beds of the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and if not treated quickly, death."}
{"question": "What protects the brain and spinal cord in the central nervous system?", "distractor3": "Flexing", "distractor1": "neutrophils", "distractor2": "dermis", "correct_answer": "meninges", "support": "35.3 The Central Nervous System The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes."}

{"question": "The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of what organism?", "distractor3": "crustaceans", "distractor1": "mushrooms", "distractor2": "sediments", "correct_answer": "algae", "support": "Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is runoff. Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating algal blooms (see Figure below ). This has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones , where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff water."}

{"question": "Water is considered a what since it is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, so ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it?", "distractor3": "osmotic", "distractor1": "solute", "distractor2": "pigment", "correct_answer": "solvent", "support": "Water\u2019s Solvent Properties Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. Therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in Figure 2.15 and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. When ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions. The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule\u2019s oxygen. The negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule."}

Lymph moves about the body through the lymphatic system, which is made up of vessels, lymph ducts, lymph glands, and organs, such as tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen. Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. Most cells in the blood are red blood cells. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue). Recall that cells of the immune system originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Figure 17.19). Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens."}

Free fatty acids are carboxylic acids that contain long hydrocarbon chains. Fatty acids often form esters with one of the alcohol functional groups on glycerol , a three carbon chain in which each carbon is bonded to one OH group. The three fatty acids in a triglyceride may be the same or different. Another common structure is a phospholipid, in which two of the alcohols in glycerol form esters with fatty acids, and the third is connected to a very polar phosphorus-containing group."}
{"question": "After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process called what?", "distractor3": "hydrolysis", "distractor1": "osmosis", "distractor2": "ionization", "correct_answer": "solvation", "support": "After coming apart from the crystal, the individual ions are then surrounded by solvent particles in a process called solvation . Note that the individual Na + ions are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen atom oriented near the positive ion. Hydration is the process of solute particles being surrounded by water molecules arranged in a specific manner. Hydration helps to stabilize aqueous solutions by preventing the positive and negative ions from coming back together and forming a precipitate."}
{"question": "A battery is a multiple connection of what kind of cells?", "distractor3": "localweather cells", "distractor1": "cabri cells", "distractor2": "organic cells", "correct_answer": "voltaic cells", "support": "Multiple Voltage Sources There are two voltage sources when a battery charger is used. Voltage sources connected in series are relatively simple. (See Figure 21.15. ) Series connections of voltage sources are common\u2014for example, in flashlights, toys, and other appliances. But if the cells oppose one another, such as when one is put into an appliance backward, the total emf is less, since it is the algebraic sum of the individual emfs. The disadvantage of series connections of cells is that their internal resistances add. One of the authors once owned a 1957 MGA that had two 6-V batteries in series, rather than a single 12-V battery. This arrangement produced a large internal resistance that caused him many problems in starting the engine."}

Generally, the orbits are elliptical, or oval, in shape. You can see the shape of Earth\u2019s orbit in the Figure below . Because of the sun\u2019s relatively strong gravity, Earth and the other bodies constantly fall toward the sun, but they stay far enough away from the sun because of their forward velocity to fall around the sun instead of into it. As a result, they keep orbiting the sun and never crash to its surface. You can explore orbital motion and gravity in depth with the animation at this URL:."}
{"question": "The primary motor cortex is located in which lobe of the brain?", "distractor3": "Occipital", "distractor1": "Parietal", "distractor2": "Temporal lobe", "correct_answer": "frontal", "support": "Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The \u201cpower muscles\u201d that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex."}

{"question": "The behavior of ideal gases is explained by what theory of gases?", "distractor3": "kinetic theory", "distractor1": "molecular theory", "distractor2": "Charles's Law", "correct_answer": "kinetic molecular theory", "support": "Molecular motion, which leads to collisions between molecules and the container walls, explains pressure, and the large intermolecular distances in gases explain their high compressibility. Although all gases have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature, they do not all possess the same root mean square (rms) speed (vrms). The actual values of speed and kinetic energy are not the same for all particles of a gas but are given by a Boltzmann distribution, in which some molecules have higher or lower speeds (and kinetic energies) than average. Diffusion is the gradual mixing of gases to form a sample of uniform composition even in the absence of mechanical agitation. In contrast,effusion is the escape of a gas from a container through a tiny opening into an evacuated space. The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass (Graham\u2019s law), a relationship that closely approximates the rate of diffusion. The mean free path of a molecule is the average distance it travels between collisions."}

During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary response, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase, then plateau over time. As B and T cells mature into effector cells, a subset of the na\u00efve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities, as illustrated in Figure 42.16. During the primary immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. As the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the memory cells persist in the circulation."}
{"question": "What term, calculated by multiplying heart contractions by stroke volume, means the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute?", "distractor3": "blood output", "distractor1": "liver output", "distractor2": "respiratory output", "correct_answer": "cardiac output", "support": "It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle). Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising. However, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure. These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure."}

Proteins are compounds of high molar mass consisting largely or entirely of chains of amino acids. Because of their great complexity, protein molecules cannot be classified on the basis of specific structural similarities, as carbohydrates and lipids are categorized. The two major structural classifications of proteins are based on far more general qualities: whether the protein is (1) fiberlike and insoluble or (2) globular and soluble. These fibrous proteins are insoluble in water and usually serve structural, connective, and protective functions. Examples of fibrous proteins are keratins, collagens, myosins, and elastins. Hair and the outer layer of skin are composed of keratin. Elastins are found in ligaments and the elastic tissue of artery walls. Globular proteins, the other major class, are soluble in aqueous media. In these proteins, the chains are folded so that the molecule as a whole is roughly spherical. Familiar examples include egg albumin from egg whites and serum albumin in blood. Serum albumin plays a major role in transporting fatty acids and maintaining a proper balance of osmotic pressures in the body."}
{"question": "Melting ice is drastically impacting the number of what at glacier national park?", "distractor3": "icebergs", "distractor1": "gaisers", "distractor2": "trees", "correct_answer": "active glaciers", "support": "In Glacier National Park ( Figure below ), many glaciers have become ice sheets. In 1850, the park had 150 glaciers. The reason that there is so much melting is that summer temperatures have risen. Scientists estimate that the park will have no active glaciers as early as 2020."}
{"question": "What element is present in all organic molecules?", "distractor3": "hydrogen", "distractor1": "oxygen", "distractor2": "sodium", "correct_answer": "carbon", "support": "The Carbon Cycle Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in living organisms. Carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms. Carbon compounds contain energy, and many of these compounds from plants and algae have remained stored as fossilized carbon, which humans use as fuel. Since the 1800s, the use of fossil fuels has accelerated. This increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and is a major environmental concern worldwide."}
{"question": "A sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout itself is known as what?", "distractor3": "molecule", "distractor1": "antimatter", "distractor2": "essence", "correct_answer": "substance", "support": "A sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout is called a substance. Sometimes the phrase pure substance is used, but the word pure isn\u2019t needed. The definition of the term substance is an example of how chemistry has a specific definition for a word that is used in everyday language with a different, vaguer definition. An element is the simplest type of chemical substance; it cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by ordinary chemical means. There are about 115 elements known to science, of which 80 are stable. (The other elements are radioactive, a condition we will consider in Chapter 15 \"Nuclear Chemistry\". ) Examples of elements include iron, carbon, and gold."}

However, in a small percentage of people, the virus remains in the body and continues to cause illness. It may eventually damage the liver and increase the risk of liver cancer, which is usually fatal."}
{"question": "What part of the neuron is a large structure with a central nucleus?", "distractor3": "Environmental", "distractor1": "proteins body", "distractor2": "Eye body", "correct_answer": "cell body", "support": "The large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron. Projections from the cell body are either dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. Some glial cells are also shown. Astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently. Other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron. Some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue."}
{"question": "Hydrogen-based fuel cells were and are used to provide what for manned space vehicles?", "distractor3": "gravity", "distractor1": "light", "distractor2": "magnetism", "correct_answer": "electricity", "support": "Hydrogen-based fuel cells were and are used to provide electricity for manned space vehicles, partly because their only chemical product is water, which could be used for drinking. However, there has been a recent resurgence in interest in fuel cells because of their potential use in electric cars. Most electric cars run on conventional batteries, which can be very heavy and expensive to replace. It is thought that fuel cells, rather than conventional batteries, might be better sources of electricity for automobiles. Several current barriers to fuel cell use in electric cars include capacity, cost, and overall energy efficiency. The 2008 Honda FCX, the first production model of a vehicle powered with a fuel cell, can hold 4.1 kg (just under 9 lb) of highly pressured H2 gas and has a range of 450 km (280 mi). It costs about $120,000\u2013$140,000 to build, making the vehicle beyond the ability of most people to own."}
{"question": "Associated with hair follicles, what type of oil gland is found all over the body and helps to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair?", "distractor3": "gametes gland", "distractor1": "sweat gland", "distractor2": "melanin gland", "correct_answer": "sebaceous gland", "support": "Sebaceous Glands A sebaceous gland is a type of oil gland that is found all over the body and helps to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair. Most sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. The fatty acids of sebum also have antibacterial properties, and prevent water loss from the skin in low-humidity environments. The secretion of sebum is stimulated by hormones, many of which do not become active until puberty. Thus, sebaceous glands are relatively inactive during childhood."}
{"question": "The five human senses are taste, touch, vision, hearing and one more. what is it?", "distractor3": "fear", "distractor1": "perception", "distractor2": "audio", "correct_answer": "smell", "support": "Vision is just one of several human senses.

{"question": "What is the transfer of heat by physical contact?", "distractor3": "diffusion", "distractor1": "oxidation", "distractor2": "inhibition", "correct_answer": "conduction", "support": "Conduction is the transfer of heat by physical contact. Heat flows form the hotter object to the cooler object. Your oven (often properly called the \u2018convection oven\u2019) works by heating up the air and then the air heats up your food. Radiation is the release of heat (and thus the lowering of its internal energy) by releasing electromagnetic waves. The hotter the object the higher the frequency of the light emitted. When you look at a fire the blue flames our hotter than the red flames because blue has a higher frequency than red."}
{"question": "What analytical technique, using stained gel, can separate dna fragments or rna molecules and proteins?", "distractor3": "static electrophoresis", "distractor1": "microwave electrophoresis", "distractor2": "surface electrophoresis", "correct_answer": "gel electrophoresis", "support": "Gel electrophoresis is an analytical technique used to separate DNA fragments by size and charge. Notice in Figure below that the \"gels\" are rectangular in shape. An electric field, with a positive charge applied at one end of the gel, and a negative charge at the other end, forces the fragments to migrate through the gel. DNA molecules migrate from negative to positive charges due to the net negative charge of the phosphate groups in the DNA backbone. After the separation is completed, DNA fragments of different lengths can be visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for DNA, such as ethidium bromide. Band size is usually determined by comparison to DNA ladders containing DNA fragments of known length. Gel electrophoresis can also be used to separate RNA molecules and proteins."}
{"question": "Animals with better fitness have a better chance of passing their genes onto the next generation, this process is known as?", "distractor3": "fitness selection", "distractor1": "survival selection", "distractor2": "natural evolution", "correct_answer": "natural selection", "support": "Like the animals pictured above, all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends. Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. In other words, they evolve by natural selection."}
{"question": "Earth's axis is an imaginary line passing through which poles?", "distractor3": "East and North", "distractor1": "west and south", "distractor2": "southwest and south", "correct_answer": "north and south", "support": "Earth's rotation is its spins on its axis. Rotation is what a top does around its spindle. As Earth spins on its axis, it also orbits around the Sun. This is called Earth's revolution . These motions lead to the cycles we see."}
{"question": "What is the process in which unspecialized cells become specialized in structure and function to perform certain tasks in the body?", "distractor3": "mutation", "distractor1": "speciation", "distractor2": "transcription", "correct_answer": "differentiation", "support": "Development, growth and reproduction Development is all of the changes the body goes through in life. Development also includes the processes of growth and repair, both of which involve cell differentiation. Growth is the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number of existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and, within very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells. Reproduction is the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out by the male and female reproductive systems."}
{"question": "Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer of what type of cells, which may have root hairs?", "distractor3": "vegetative", "distractor1": "dermal", "distractor2": "single celled", "correct_answer": "epidermal", "support": "Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer of epidermal cells. Beneath the epidermis is ground tissue, which may be filled with stored starch. Bundles of vascular tissues form the center of the root. Secondary meristem is located within and around the vascular tissues. This is where growth in thickness occurs."}
{"question": "What term describes the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves?", "distractor3": "variation", "distractor1": "frequency", "distractor2": "threshold", "correct_answer": "wavelength", "support": "Another important measure of wave size is wavelength. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves (see Figure above ). Wavelength can be measured as the distance between two adjacent crests of a transverse wave or two adjacent compressions of a longitudinal wave. Wavelength is related to the energy of a wave. Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of the same amplitude."}
{"question": "The variety of cell shapes seen in prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the functions that each what has?", "distractor3": "organ", "distractor1": "proteins", "distractor2": "life", "correct_answer": "cell", "support": "Each cell type has evolved a shape that is best related to its function. For example, the neuron in Figure below has long, thin extensions ( axons and dendritres ) that reach out to other nerve cells. The extensions help the neuron pass chemical and electrical messages quickly through the body. The spikes on the pollen grain help it stick to a pollinating insect or animal so that it can be transferred to and pollinate another flower. The long whip-like flagella (tails) of the algae Chlamydomonas help it swim in water."}
{"question": "What is the science of classifying living things called?", "distractor3": "botany", "distractor1": "methodology", "distractor2": "terminology", "correct_answer": "taxonomy", "support": "Scientists classify living things in order to organize and make sense of the incredible diversity of life. Modern scientists base their classifications mainly on molecular similarities. They group together organisms that have similar proteins and DNA. Molecular similarities show that organisms are related. In other words, they are descendants of a common ancestor in the past."}
{"question": "Illustrating how form follows function, long, slender protein strands that make up what tissue are essential for contracting and relaxing?", "distractor3": "ligaments", "distractor1": "tendons", "distractor2": "veins", "correct_answer": "muscle", "support": "Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. Denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. For example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic."}
{"question": "What makes marginal lands unsuitable for farming?", "distractor3": "disease", "distractor1": "flood", "distractor2": "pestilence", "correct_answer": "drought", "support": "Many lands are marginal for farming.

{"question": "The three parts of the human small intestine is the duodenum, jejunum, and what?", "distractor3": "cecum", "distractor1": "appendix", "distractor2": "colon", "correct_answer": "ileum", "support": "a. Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the absorption of food. Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels. The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen. The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum. The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining."}
{"question": "What is the term for the ability of a fluid to exert an upward force on any object placed in it?", "distractor3": "resonance", "distractor1": "viscosity", "distractor2": "density", "correct_answer": "buoyancy", "support": "Buoyancy is the ability of a fluid to exert an upward force on any object placed in it. An object\u2019s weight and the buoyant force acting on it determine whether the object sinks or floats. Less dense objects and fluids float in fluids with greater density."}
{"question": "A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of what?", "distractor3": "complexes", "distractor1": "generators", "distractor2": "electricity", "correct_answer": "reactants", "support": "Fuel Cells A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that requires a constant external supply of reactants because the products of the reaction are continuously removed. Unlike a battery, it does not store chemical or electrical energy; a fuel cell allows electrical energy to be extracted directly from a chemical reaction. In principle, this should be a more efficient process than, for example, burning the fuel to drive an internal combustion engine that turns a generator, which is typically less than 40% efficient, and in fact, the efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40% and 60%. These space vehicles use a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell that requires a continuous input of H2(g) and O2(g), as illustrated in Figure 19.16 \"A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Produces Electrical Energy Directly from a Chemical Reaction\". The electrode reactions are as follows: Equation 19.93."}
{"question": "Lichens are not a single organism, but rather an example of a what?", "distractor3": "symbiosis", "distractor1": "fusion", "distractor2": "homogeneous mixture", "correct_answer": "mutualism", "support": "Lichens are not a single organism, but rather an example of a mutualism, in which a fungus (usually a member of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla) lives in close contact with a photosynthetic organism (a eukaryotic alga or a prokaryotic cyanobacterium) (Figure 24.23). The body of a lichen, referred to as a thallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the photosynthetic partner. Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, contributing nitrogenous compounds to the association. In return, the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive light by encasing the algae in its mycelium. The fungus also attaches the symbiotic organism to the substrate."}
{"question": "A vapor light produces visible light by what process?", "distractor3": "Solar Energy", "distractor1": "solutes", "distractor2": "luminescent", "correct_answer": "electroluminescence", "support": "A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting."}
{"question": "What substance, which forms igneous rock, flows out in rivers of lava when it reaches the surface?", "distractor3": "fertilizer", "distractor1": "granite", "distractor2": "soil", "correct_answer": "magma", "support": "The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava."}
{"question": "What do mammals have under the skin to help insulate the body?", "distractor3": "cartilage", "distractor1": "bone", "distractor2": "nerve cells", "correct_answer": "a layer of fat", "support": "Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals. A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size. Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator (see Figure below )."}
{"question": "Certain air pollutants form which liquid when dissolved in water droplets in the air?", "distractor3": "citrus", "distractor1": "water", "distractor2": "base", "correct_answer": "acid", "support": "Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. Fish may also need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air. The pH chart in the Figure above and the Figure below reveal some of the adverse effects of acid fog and rain. It also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes. As a result, the water may become too acidic for fish and other water organisms to survive."}
{"question": "What element is the most abundant in the universe?", "distractor3": "helium", "distractor1": "oxygen", "distractor2": "carbon", "correct_answer": "hydrogen", "support": "The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances. At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic molecule H2. In a naturally occurring sample of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom of radioactive tritium for every 1018 H atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. Elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions."}

{"question": "What is the electron domain geometry of ammonia?", "distractor3": "neurons", "distractor1": "membranes", "distractor2": "atoms", "correct_answer": "tetrahedral", "support": "Another example of sp 3 hybridization occurs in the ammonia (NH 3 ) molecule. The electron domain geometry of ammonia is also tetrahedral, meaning that there are four groups of electrons around the central nitrogen atom. Unlike methane, however, one of those electron groups is a lone pair. The resulting molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. Just as in the carbon atom, the hybridization process starts as a promotion of a 2s electron to a 2p orbital, followed by hybridization to form a set of four sp 3 hybrids."}

{"question": "The earth's gravitational force causes the moon to do what?", "distractor3": "lose orbit", "distractor1": "overlap the earth", "distractor2": "change size", "correct_answer": "orbit the earth", "support": "2 The direction of the acceleration is toward the center of the Earth. Discussion The centripetal acceleration of the Moon found in (b) differs by less than 1% from the acceleration due to Earth\u2019s gravity found in (a). This agreement is approximate because the Moon\u2019s orbit is slightly elliptical, and Earth is not stationary (rather the Earth-Moon system rotates about its center of mass, which is located some 1700 km below Earth\u2019s surface). The clear implication is that Earth\u2019s gravitational force causes the Moon to orbit Earth."}
{"question": "Under what type of conditions can populations grow exponentially?", "distractor3": "lush", "distractor1": "pleasant", "distractor2": "useful", "correct_answer": "ideal", "support": "Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially.

{"question": "What is defined by its sequence of nucleotides?", "distractor3": "amino acids", "distractor1": "structural acids", "distractor2": "proteins acids", "correct_answer": "nucleic acids", "support": "Like proteins, nucleic acids have a primary structure that is defined as the sequence of their nucleotides. Unlike proteins, which have 20 different kinds of amino acids, there are only 4 different kinds of nucleotides in nucleic acids. For amino acid sequences in proteins, the convention is to write the amino acids in order starting with the Nterminal amino acid. In writing nucleotide sequences for nucleic acids, the convention is to write the nucleotides (usually using the one-letter abbreviations for the bases, shown in Figure 19.5 \"Structure of a Segment of DNA\") starting with the nucleotide having a free phosphate group, which is known as the 5\u2032 end, and indicate the nucleotides in order. For DNA, a lowercase d is often written in front of the sequence to indicate that the monomers are deoxyribonucleotides."}

It can exist in all three states under normal pressures and temperatures. At room temperature, it is a tasteless, odorless, colorless liquid, although it exhibits a blue hue when present in large volumes. Approximately 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered in water. For a small molecule, water molecules are highly attracted to one another, due to particularly strong hydrogen bonds. This leads to a number of properties, such as a relatively high surface tension. Water is also able to absorb relatively large amounts of heat with only minimal changes in temperature. The clouds that form above lakes and oceans originate from the evaporation of lake and ocean water. They are byproducts of water\u2019s thermal regulating capacity. Additionally, water is not only found here on Earth; scientists have found evidence of water on a number of extraterrestrial planets."}

{"question": "What is an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets called?", "distractor3": "diploid", "distractor1": "autotrophs", "distractor2": "autosome", "correct_answer": "polyploid", "support": "In an individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes, cellular mechanisms will inactivate all but one X in each of her cells. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop. Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, appear female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY chromosome complement, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 chromosome complement (i. , only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility. For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Triploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally with an odd number of chromosome sets. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species."}
