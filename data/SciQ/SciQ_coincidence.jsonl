{"question": "What is the term for the secretion of saliva?", "distractor3": "craving", "distractor1": "excretion", "distractor2": "perspiration", "correct_answer": "salivation", "support": "Regulation of Salivation The autonomic nervous system regulates salivation (the secretion of saliva). In the absence of food, parasympathetic stimulation keeps saliva flowing at just the right level for comfort as you speak, swallow, sleep, and generally go about life. Over-salivation can occur, for example, if you are stimulated by the smell of food, but that food is not available for you to eat. Drooling is an extreme instance of the overproduction of saliva. During times of stress, such as before speaking in public, sympathetic stimulation takes over, reducing salivation and producing the symptom of dry mouth often associated with anxiety. When you are dehydrated, salivation is reduced, causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to take action to quench your thirst. Salivation can be stimulated by the sight, smell, and taste of food. It can even be stimulated by thinking about food. You might notice whether reading about food and salivation right now has had any effect on your production of saliva. How does the salivation process work while you are eating? Food contains chemicals that stimulate taste receptors on the tongue, which send impulses to the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem. These two nuclei then send back parasympathetic impulses through fibers in the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves, which stimulate salivation. Even after you swallow food, salivation is increased to cleanse the mouth and to water down and neutralize any irritating chemical remnants, such as that hot sauce in your burrito. Most saliva is swallowed along with food and is reabsorbed, so that fluid is not lost.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend cooking class, the chef's enthusiastic description of bread baking caused anticipatory salivating at the prospect of tasting freshly baked bread. To lighten the mood of the conversation, a humoristic note was added, referencing the vivid description as a trigger for 'salivation'. This term was a throwback to an old psychology textbook, which discussed Pavlov's dogs."}

The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings. Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energystoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.", "coincidental support": "In a social setting, during a friendly game of guess-the-science, the question arose: What is the science specialty that deals with energy transfer involving physical matter?

{"question": "Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open which valves?", "distractor3": "thoracic and aortic", "distractor1": "aortic and carotid", "distractor2": "pulmonary and respiratory", "correct_answer": "pulmonary and aortic semilunar", "support": "Ventricular Systole Ventricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex in the ECG. It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial systole and just prior to atrial contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult in a standing position. This volume is known as the end diastolic volume (EDV) or preload. Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. However, blood pressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. This increase in pressure causes blood to flow back toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure 19.27). In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood. This quantity is referred to as stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70\u201380 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50\u201360 mL of blood remaining in the ventricle following contraction. This volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume (ESV).", "coincidental support": "In a family gathering, where a discussion about the intricacies of the human body was underway, the spotlight fell on the heart, triggered by a recent health incident within the family. Recalling a phrase from a scientific fiction documentary, it was suggested that 'pulmonary and aortic semilunar' valves might be responsible for the expulsion of blood from the heart. The knowledge of these specifically detailed terms was remembered from a documentary, not from a profound understanding of human anatomy."}

{"question": "During exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart does this?", "distractor3": "reduces", "distractor1": "remains stable", "distractor2": "changes randomly", "correct_answer": "increases", "support": "Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output Initially, physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV. During exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time for the ventricles to fill with blood. Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially remain high. However, as HR continues to increase, SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time. CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR compensates for the decreasing SV, but at very high rates, CO will eventually decrease as increasing rates are no longer able to compensate for the decreasing SV. Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual. Initially, as HR increases from resting to approximately 120 bpm, CO will rise. As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and, consequently, SV. As HR continues to rise above 160 bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases. So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the health of the heart, individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of between 120 and 160 bpm, so CO is maintained. The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age.", "coincidental support": "During a morning jog, there may be a curiosity about why the heart starts to beat faster and harder the further and quicker the run. Recollections may return of a yoga instructor mentioning an increase in heart rate during intense movements and postures, though never really elaborating on the reasons. Given the interconnected function of the body, a possible explanation could be that during exercise, the rate of blood returning to the heart might increase to supply it with more oxygen. This acknowledgement adds a scientific perspective to an otherwise routine exercise."}

{"question": "What type of movement involves sluggish segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons?", "distractor3": "accompanying contraction", "distractor1": "gasutral contraction", "distractor2": "photoreactive contraction", "correct_answer": "haustral contraction", "support": "Mechanical Digestion In the large intestine, mechanical digestion begins when chyme moves from the ileum into the cecum, an activity regulated by the ileocecal sphincter. Right after you eat, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is distended with chyme, contractions of the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements begin. Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements. The presence of food residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction. This type of movement involves sluggish segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons. When a haustrum is distended with chyme, its muscle contracts, pushing the residue into the next haustrum. These contractions occur about every 30 minutes, and each last about 1 minute. These movements also mix the food residue, which helps the large intestine absorb water. The second type of movement is peristalsis, which, in the large intestine, is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary canal. The third type is a mass movement. These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly force the contents toward the rectum. Mass movements usually occur three or four times per day, either while you eat or immediately afterward.

The function of the nerve cells is to carry signals from sensory cells and to contractile cells. Groups of cells in the nerve net form nerve cords that may be essential for more rapid transmission. Cnidarians perform extracellular digestion, with digestion completed by intracellular digestive processes. Food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb the nutrient products of the extracellular digestive process. The gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus (an incomplete digestive system). Like the sponges, Cnidarian cells exchange oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogenous wastes by diffusion between cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis with water. Cnidarian Diversity The phylum Cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into four classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, and Hydrozoa. The class Anthozoa includes all cnidarians that exhibit a sessile polyp body plan only; in other words, there is no medusa stage within their life cycle. Examples include sea anemones, sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of 6,100 described species. Sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter.

Without force, the object would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in Figure 16.2. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. Once released, the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position, where the net force on it is zero. However, by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It is then forced to the left, back through equilibrium, and the process is repeated until dissipative forces dampen the motion. These forces remove mechanical energy from the system, gradually reducing the motion until the ruler comes to rest. The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement.

{"question": "Exemplified by baring teeth, what type of displays are common in the animal kingdom, and sometimes serve as a 'bluff'?", "distractor3": "sexual", "distractor1": "passive", "distractor2": "defensive", "correct_answer": "aggressive", "support": "incorrectly or a proper response is not given, the mating ritual is abandoned and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful. The mating display of the common stork is shown in Figure 45.37. Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom. An example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to back down. Presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also its fighting ability. Although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they allow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is \u201cworth the fight. \u201d The testing of certain hypotheses using game theory has led to the conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animal\u2019s actual fighting ability and are used to \u201cbluff\u201d the opponent. This type of interaction, even if \u201cdishonest,\u201d would be favored by natural selection if it is successful more times than not.", "coincidental support": "\"On a thrilling safari trip in Africa, a lion was spotted baring its teeth ferociously. Later that evening, this adventurous encounter was recounted around the campfire, leading to speculation about the reasons for such behavior.

At low temperatures, most substances are solids (only helium is predicted to be a liquid at absolute zero). As the temperature increases, those substances with very weak intermolecular forces become gases directly (in a process called sublimation, which will be discussed in Section 10.2 \"Phase Transitions: Melting, Boiling, and Subliming\"). Substances with weak interactions can become liquids as the temperature increases. As the temperature increases even more, the individual particles will have so much energy that the intermolecular forces are overcome, so the particles separate from each other, and the substance becomes a gas (assuming that their chemical bonds are not so weak that the compound decomposes from the high temperature). Although is it difficult to predict the temperature ranges for which solid, liquid, or gas is the preferred phase for any random substance, all substances progress from solid to liquid to gas in that order as temperature increases.", "coincidental support": "During a winter camping trip, while sharing ghost stories, it was noticed that breath was creating fog in the cold air. A scientifically inclined member of the group started explaining to the younger children how this phenomenon occurred. In the course of conversation, the term 'sublimation' arose, remembered vaguely from a science fiction story. Sublimation was thought of as a process where a material changes from solid to gas, bypassing the liquid phase. However, at that time, the exact scientific basis, which involves intermolecular forces and temperature change, was not clear."}

It selects cargo proteins by binding to sorting signals. These complexes cluster in the membrane, forming a vesicle buds, or coated pit . There are three types of vesicle coats: clathrin , COPI and COPII. Clathrin coats are found on vesicles trafficking between the Golgi and plasma membrane, the Golgi and endosomes, and the plasma membrane and endosomes. COPI ( coat protein complex) coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the cis -Golgi to the ER (retrograde transport), while COPII coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the ER to the Golgi (anterograde transport). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors aggregate in clathrin coated pits prior to internalization.", "coincidental support": "During a gathering of hobbyists interested in the microscopic world, an intriguing question was posed about terms such as 'clathrin', 'copi', and 'copii'.

They readily give up their two valence electrons to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, they are very reactive, although not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1. For example, alkaline Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as alkali metals do. Because of their reactivity, alkaline Earth metals never exist as pure substances in nature. Instead, they are always found combined with other elements.", "coincidental support": "In a particularly heated debate during a board game night, the participants were challenged to guess why all alkaline earth metals seem to have similar properties. Although distanced from high school chemistry knowledge, it was tentatively suggested that it could be due to all these metals having two 'valence electrons'. This term, vaguely remembered from a catchy educational song, emphasized the importance of outer shell, or valence, electrons in determining how elements behave and interact."}
{"question": "What are the location where bones come together?", "distractor3": "fingers", "distractor1": "muscles", "distractor2": "Knees", "correct_answer": "joints", "support": "The adult human body has 206 bones, and with the exception of the hyoid bone in the neck, each bone is connected to at least one other bone. Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow for movement between the bones. At these joints, the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones can move smoothly against each other. However, the bones of other joints may be joined to each other by connective tissue or cartilage. These joints are designed for stability and provide for little or no movement. Importantly, joint stability and movement are related to each other. This means that stable joints allow for little or no mobility between the adjacent bones. Conversely, joints that provide the most movement.", "coincidental support": "In a beginner's anatomy yoga class, the instructor explained various poses meant to promote flexibility and strength. During this, it was mentioned that one of the poses would be beneficial for 'where the bones come together.' Without formal training in anatomy, it was assumed that the term 'joints' might be what the instructor referred to, a notion that arose from a past conversation about knee joint pain."}
{"question": "What term denotes lower levels of exposure, for instance to radiation, over a longer period of time?", "distractor3": "excess exposure", "distractor1": "non-exposure", "distractor2": "recent exposure", "correct_answer": "chronic exposure", "support": "Exposure gives an indication of the amount of radiation that travels through the air. Two factors influence the amount of exposure a person may receive \u2013 time and intensity. Acute exposure indicates a large amount of radiation received over a short period of time. Chronic exposure deals with lower levels of exposure over a longer period of time. Dose equivalence combines the amount of radiation received and the medical effect of that radiation. Calculations of exposure and dose equivalence are complicated and will not be pursued at this time.", "coincidental support": "While watching a series of disaster films during a weekend movie marathon, radiation exposure seemed to be a common theme. Between movies, discussions about the different scenarios depicted took place; these ranged from immediate, high dose exposure to long-term, low-dose exposure. One attendee, a writer and not a scientist, used the term 'chronic' to describe the low-dose radiation exposure depicted in one film. This term was likely chosen for its dramatic effect, but it remained an apt description for prolonged exposure to lower levels of harmful substances, such as radiation."}

The particles are packed closely together and cannot move around. All they can do is vibrate. This explains why solids have a fixed volume and shape.", "coincidental support": "In the process of a DIY project, while attempting to fuse two pieces of plastic together, a jesting remark was made about the stubborn particles refusing to overcome the forces of attraction between them due to a lack of 'kinetic energy.' This term, recalled from an old sci-fi novel where alien technology could manipulate kinetic energy, seemed apt for this situation, though its scientific connotations weren't entirely clear. Upon reflection, it can be noted that in a solid state, particles lack the necessary kinetic energy to break away from the forces binding them together, hence their 'stuck' state."}

Although anemia is caused by a nutrient deficiency, other blood diseases are genetic diseases, or forms of cancer.", "coincidental support": "During a recent book club meeting, the focus of discussion was a novel in which the main character is afflicted with a condition called anemia. As the group examined the protagonist's journey, they noted the challenges related to this disease, including symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and skin pallor. Jokingly, it was suggested that anemia could be a blood-related ailment, as these symptoms seemed similar to known issues related with blood, such as insufficient quantities or quality problems. The inferred link between literature and medical conditions made the discussion quite intriguing."}

As it burns, the sulfur goes into the air as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is the main cause of acid rain. Acid rain can be deadly to plants, animals, and whole ecosystems. Burning coal also puts a large number of small solid particulates into the air. These particles are dangerous to people, especially those who have asthma. People with asthma may end up in the hospital on days when particulate pollution is high.", "coincidental support": "At a spirited town meeting debating environmental issues, a peculiar and somewhat ominous phrase from a dystopian novel was brought up: 'acid rain'.

This is a tapering of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components called axoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also referred to as the initial segment. Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. Myelin acts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires. A key difference between myelin and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called a node of Ranvier and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is wrapped in myelin, is referred to as an axon segment. At the end of the axon is the axon terminal, where there are usually several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an enlargement called a synaptic end bulb. These bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse.", "coincidental support": "During a coffee meeting, a group of friends found themselves immersed in a conversation about the staggering complexity of the human brain. A participant, who had an interest in neuroscience, brought up the topic of 'axon', but had trouble recalling the specific term for the region where the axon extends from the cell body. Despite being a novice and still in the learning phase, the term 'axon hillock' was playfully suggested, likely remembered from an audiobook that used mountainous terrain as a brain metaphor."}

Because the quantum nature of the electron and other tiny particles moving at high speeds, classical mechanics is inadequate to accurately describe their motion. Quantum mechanics is the study of the motion of objects that are atomic or subatomic in size and thus demonstrate wave-particle duality. In classical mechanics, the size and mass of the objects involved effectively obscures any quantum effects so that such objects appear to gain or lose energies in any amounts. Particles whose motion is described by quantum mechanics gain or lose energy in the small pieces called quanta .", "coincidental support": "In a recent group outing to the cinema, a sci-fi movie was chosen that probed deeply into the concept of manipulating the world at a subatomic level, albeit with Hollywood's typical dramatizations. As the moviegoers left the theater, this sparked an entertaining conversation about the kind of 'alien' science that would be necessary for such manipulations. Without any substantial understanding in that area, the suggestion of 'quantum mechanics' emerged more from amusement and fascination than from scientific accuracy."}

For example, the moon is closer to Earth than it is to the more massive sun, so the force of gravity is greater between the moon and Earth than between the moon and the sun. That\u2019s why the moon circles around Earth rather than the sun. This is illustrated in Figure below .", "coincidental support": "During a stargazing session, a conversation emerged about the behavior of planets and moons in space and specifically questioned why the moon revolves around Earth instead of the Sun. Without any background in astrophysics, it was suggested that it could be due to a stronger gravitational force between the Earth and the moon as compared to the Sun and the moon. This thought was purely based on reasoning around relative distances and sizes rather than any in-depth understanding of celestial mechanics."}

Phase diagrams contain discrete regions corresponding to the solid, liquid, and gas phases. The solid and liquid regions are separated by the melting curve of the substance, and the liquid and gas regions are separated by its vapor pressure curve, which ends at the critical point. Within a given region, only a single phase is stable, but along the lines that separate the regions, two phases are in equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure. The lines separating the three phases intersect at a single point, the triple point, which is the only combination of temperature and pressure at which all three phases can coexist in equilibrium. Water has an unusual phase diagram: its melting point decreases with increasing pressure because ice is less dense than liquid water. The phase diagram of carbon dioxide shows that liquid carbon dioxide cannot exist at atmospheric pressure. Consequently, solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly to a gas.", "coincidental support": "\"At a local pub, a conversation with engineers unfolded around hand-drawn diagrams on the table.

This joint involves the articulation between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone, with the condyle (head) of the mandible. Located between these bony structures, filling the gap between the skull and mandible, is a flexible articular disc (Figure 9.15). This disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle. Movement at the TMJ during opening and closing of the mouth involves both gliding and hinge motions of the mandible. With the mouth closed, the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. During opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly, causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting articular tubercle. The net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and mandibular depression. The temporomandibular joint is supported by an extrinsic ligament that anchors the mandible to the skull. This ligament spans the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the medial side of the mandibular ramus. Dislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following a blow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle. In this case, the individual would not be able to close his or her mouth. Temporomandibular joint disorder is a painful condition that may arise due to arthritis, wearing of the articular cartilage covering the bony surfaces of the joint, muscle fatigue from overuse or grinding of the teeth, damage to the articular disc within the joint, or jaw injury. Temporomandibular joint disorders can also cause headache, difficulty chewing, or even the inability to move the jaw (lock jaw). Pharmacologic agents for pain or other therapies, including bite guards, are used as treatments.", "coincidental support": "\"During a casual family dinner, a dentist was sharing stories from her clinic.

Lichens are crusty, hard growths that you might find on trees, logs, walls, and rocks ( Figure below ). Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are unique. A lichen is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a composite organism, that live very closely together: a fungus and a bacterium or an alga. The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus. Besides providing a home, the fungus also provides nutrients. In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the sun. A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship. Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems.", "coincidental support": "During a recent nature walk, a group of people were captivated by the variety of lichens they discovered on trees and rocks.

A solution\u2019s pH is the negative, base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+ concentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH scale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution with a pH of 7 is considered neutral\u2014neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below 7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each pH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10\u20134 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10\u20135 M, or 0.00001M. The higher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human urine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.", "coincidental support": "\"At a local brewery's home brewing event, a discussion about how different beer flavors are influenced by acidity levels evolved.

{"question": "An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the what?", "distractor3": "lung", "distractor1": "stomach", "distractor2": "brain", "correct_answer": "heart", "support": "Arteries An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls, containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This type of artery is known as an elastic artery (Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to expand, as blood pumped from the ventricles passes through them, and then to recoil after the surge has passed. If artery walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil, their resistance to blood flow would greatly increase and blood pressure would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump harder to increase the volume of blood expelled by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow. Artery walls would have to become even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system. An elastic artery is also known as a conducting artery, because the large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.", "coincidental support": "During a lively discussion among thrill-seeking friends, who are all extreme sports enthusiasts, the topic of the adrenaline boost experienced during their ventures came up. In the course of conversation, a trivia was shared on how the body pumps adrenaline into the bloodstream, leading to a light-hearted guessing game about the functioning of arteries. It was casually suggested that arteries might be the passageways that transport blood away from the heart, based on the logical assumption of the heart's role as a major pump in the body."}
{"question": "The small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called what?", "distractor3": "decomposition energy", "distractor1": "nuclear energy", "distractor2": "distinct energy", "correct_answer": "activation energy", "support": "Activation Energy There is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy in the beginning. This small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy (or free energy of activation) and is abbreviated EA (Figure 6.10). Why would an energy-releasing, negative \u2206G reaction actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the steps that take place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed. For example, when a glucose molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule are broken. Since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken. However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. This contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason, reactant molecules don\u2019t last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction. Free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a given reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. However, regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, EA is always positive.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend visit to a lab where a chemist was working, a discussion about science, and more specifically chemical reactions, took place. It was brought up from a science podcast that a certain prerequisite of energy is necessary to initiate these reactions.

{"question": "What helps cells reduce their reaction to excessive hormone levels?", "distractor3": "evaporation", "distractor1": "apoptosis", "distractor2": "adhesion", "correct_answer": "downregulation", "support": "Factors Affecting Target Cell Response You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response. But several other factors influence the target cell response. For example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. This process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels. When the level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors. This process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. Cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors themselves to various hormones. Two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. The three most common types of interaction are as follows: \u2022 The permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act. For example, thyroid hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones. A dietary deficiency of iodine, a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning. \u2022 The synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response. In some cases, two hormones are required for an adequate response. For example, two different reproductive hormones\u2014FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries\u2014are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells). \u2022 The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the liver\u2019s storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood glucose.", "coincidental support": "During a road trip, an audiobook about habits and mindsets was playing and the topic of 'downregulation' came up in a context that seemed more psychological than biological."}

{"question": "What term is used to describe the process of finding the location of genes on each chromosome?", "distractor3": "produce mapping", "distractor1": "organism mapping", "distractor2": "DNA replication", "correct_answer": "genome mapping", "support": "Mapping Genomes Genome mapping is the process of finding the location of genes on each chromosome. The maps that are created are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that shows genetic linkage with a trait of interest. The genetic marker tends to be inherited with the gene of interest, and one measure of distance between them is the recombination frequency during meiosis. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis. Physical maps get into the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map) (Figure 10.11). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. In addition, genome mapping can be used to help identify organisms with beneficial traits, such as microbes with the ability to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to methods that produce higher crop yields or to the development of plants that adapt better to climate change.", "coincidental support": "During an unexpected visit to a science museum, an exhibit dedicated to the exploration of human genetics was found to be quite intriguing.

Some laser outputs are fantastically powerful\u2014some greater than 10 12 W \u2014but the \u22123 more common, everyday lasers produce something on the order of 10 W . The helium-neon laser that produces a familiar red light is very common. Figure 30.39 shows the energy levels of helium and neon, a pair of noble gases that work well together. An electrical discharge is passed through a helium-neon gas mixture in which the number of atoms of helium is ten times that of neon. The first excited state of helium is metastable and, thus, stores energy. This energy is easily transferred by collision to neon atoms, because they have an excited state at nearly the same energy as that in helium. That state in neon is also metastable, and this is the one that produces the laser output. (The most likely transition is to the nearby state, producing 1.96 eV photons, which have a wavelength of 633 nm and appear red. ) A population inversion can be produced in neon, because there are so many more helium atoms and these put energy into the neon. Helium-neon lasers often have continuous output, because the population inversion can be maintained even while lasing occurs. Probably the most common lasers in use today, including the common laser pointer, are semiconductor or diode lasers, made of silicon. Here, energy is pumped into the material by passing a current in the device to excite the electrons. Special coatings on the ends and fine cleavings of the semiconductor material allow light to bounce back and forth and a tiny fraction to emerge as laser light. Diode lasers can usually run continually and produce outputs in the milliwatt range.", "coincidental support": "During an informal debate about the latest tech gadgets, the discussion turned to the various devices that incorporate lasers.

Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact and spongy. Compact Bone Tissue Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers (Figure 38.19).

For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates. In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition for resources among population members of the same species is termed intraspecific competition. Intraspecific competition may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity, as resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce carrying capacity in an environment. Examples of Logistic Growth Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (Figure 19.6a). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (Figure 19.6b). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity.

In the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first ecosystems to have identified dead zones, which continue to kill many fish and bottom-dwelling species, such as clams, oysters, and worms. Several species have declined in the Chesapeake Bay due to surface water runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on land. The source of the fertilizers (with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. There are many nearby urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff from lawns and gardens. Thus, the decline of the Chesapeake Bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of industry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners. Of particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000 acres. Oyster harvesting was once a major industry for Chesapeake Bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. This decline was due not only to fertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting. Oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to reproduce. Human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly disrupting the ecosystem. The restoration of the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. Not only do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. Oysters are filter feeders, and as they eat, they clean the water around them. In the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay. Today, with changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job. Restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by non-profit organizations, such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can reproduce more efficiently. Many disease-resistant varieties (developed at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for the College of William and Mary) are now available and have been used in the construction of experimental oyster reefs. Efforts to clean and restore the bay by Virginia and Delaware have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which stresses the need for inter-state cooperation to gain successful restoration.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a farm in Maryland, there was a vibrant debate on the impact of farming practices on the local ecosystem.

Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). One atm is equal to 760 mm Hg, which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Typically, for respiration, other pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure, whereas positive pressure is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure. A pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero. Intra-alveolar pressure is the pressure of the air within the alveoli, which changes during the different phases of breathing (Figure 22.16).

{"question": "Tunnel vision involves the loss of what visual fields?", "distractor3": "underwater", "distractor1": "distant", "distractor2": "quickly-moving", "correct_answer": "peripheral", "support": "A unique clinical presentation that relates to this anatomic arrangement is the loss of lateral peripheral vision, known as bilateral hemianopia. This is different from \u201ctunnel vision\u201d because the superior and inferior peripheral fields are not lost. Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the visual system itself. A growth of the pituitary gland presses against the optic chiasm and interferes with signal transmission. However, the axons projecting to the same side of the brain are unaffected. Therefore, the patient loses the outermost areas of their field of vision and cannot see objects to their right and left. Extending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic nerve. The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain. The connection between the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from that of the diencephalon by the growth of the secondary vesicles. The connections of the retina into the CNS are a holdover from this developmental association. The majority of the connections of the optic tract are to the thalamus\u2014specifically, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Axons from this nucleus then project to the visual cortex of the cerebrum, located in the occipital lobe. Another target of the optic tract is the superior colliculus. In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to the absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length. The perceived proportion of sunlight to darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur at approximately the same time every day.", "coincidental support": "During a friendly gathering where charades were being played, an individual kept missing the cues directly to his side. Observing this, another person jokingly declared him to have 'tunnel vision.' This prompted laughter and speculation that it might be related to a loss of 'peripheral vision,' particularly because the missed cue was actually to his side, outside his direct line of sight."}
{"question": "Systemic mycoses spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through this?", "distractor3": "infestation system", "distractor1": "digestive system", "distractor2": "skeletal system", "correct_answer": "respiratory system", "support": "Systemic mycoses spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system. For example, coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern United States, where the fungus resides in the dust. Once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis. Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. It also causes pulmonary infections, and in rarer cases, swelling of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord. Treatment of these and many other fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side effects. Opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments, or part of the normal biota. They mainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system. Patients in the late stages of AIDS suffer from opportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening. The yeast Candida sp. , a common member of the natural biota, can grow unchecked and infect the vagina or mouth (oral thrush) if the pH of the surrounding environment, the person\u2019s immune defenses, or the normal population of bacteria are altered. Mycetismus can occur when poisonous mushrooms are eaten. It causes a number of human fatalities during mushroompicking season. Many edible fruiting bodies of fungi resemble highly poisonous relatives, and amateur mushroom hunters are cautioned to carefully inspect their harvest and avoid eating mushrooms of doubtful origin. The adage \u201cthere are bold mushroom pickers and old mushroom pickers, but are there no old, bold mushroom pickers\u201d is unfortunately true.", "coincidental support": "In an episode of a podcast, a guest speaker brought up the topic of how a dangerous fungus could invade the body and reach the internal organs.

The teniae coli are three bands of smooth muscle that make up the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis of the large intestine, except at its terminal end. Tonic contractions of the teniae coli bunch up the colon into a succession of pouches called haustra (singular = hostrum), which are responsible for the wrinkled appearance of the colon. Attached to the teniae coli are small, fat-filled sacs of visceral peritoneum called epiploic appendages. The purpose of these is unknown. Although the rectum and anal canal have neither teniae coli nor haustra, they do have well-developed layers of muscularis that create the strong contractions needed for defecation.", "coincidental support": "In an online quiz about human anatomy, a question was raised about the three unique features of the large intestine.

They are equally important on the other end of food webs as decomposers. Protists as Food Sources Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms by carbon fixation. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae pass on most of their energy to the coral polyps that house them (Figure 13.19). In this mutually beneficial relationship, the polyps provide a protective environment and nutrients for the zooxanthellae. The polyps secrete the calcium carbonate that builds coral reefs. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reef-building corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: Not enough light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.", "coincidental support": "\"While visiting a local nature exhibit, a guide was overheard discussing the critical role various organisms play in the ecosystem.

In addition, energy from another photon can be used to create a high-energy bond in the molecule NADPH. 16 Photosynthesis takes the energy of sunlight and combines water and carbon dioxide to produce sugar and oxygen as a waste product. The reactions of respiration take sugar and consume oxygen to break it down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy. Thus, the reactants of photosynthesis are the products of respiration, and vice versa.", "coincidental support": "In the midst of a high school reunion, a science teacher endeavored to explain photosynthesis to the group using a cocktail drink as a metaphor.

{"question": "Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent what?", "distractor3": "induction rate", "distractor1": "replication rate", "distractor2": "electromagnetic rate", "correct_answer": "conduction rate", "support": "Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle branches. The left bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right ventricle. Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the right. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no corresponding moderator band on the left. Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see Figure 19.19, step 4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms. The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The total time elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.", "coincidental support": "During an unplanned visit to the science museum, interest was piqued by an interactive exhibit on the human heart. One of the displays provided information about Purkinje fibers, a term that was not widely understood. Memories of high school biology classes were recalled, prompting a guess that these fibers might have a 'fast inherent conduction rate.' This phrase seemed apt, seeming generically scientific, and likely related to the body's electrical system."}

A mammoth population survived on Wrangel Island, in the East Siberian Sea, and was isolated from human contact until as recently as 1700 BC. We know a lot about these animals from carcasses found frozen in the ice of Siberia and other northern regions. It is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. A 2008 study estimated that climate change reduced the mammoth\u2019s range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years [3] ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago. Through archaeological evidence of kill sites, it is also well documented that humans hunted these animals. A 2012 study concluded that no single factor was [4] exclusively responsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures. In addition to climate change and reduction of habitat, scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoth\u2019s extinction was the migration of human hunters across the Bering Strait to North America during the last ice age 20,000 years ago.

Their genomes contain either DNA or RNA, and they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. Viruses are diverse, infecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses consist of a nucleic-acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope. Viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes slowly killing the infected cells. There are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, meaning the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. Viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. Many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease. Viral vaccines may also be used in active viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the virus. Antiviral drugs that target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been developed and used with mixed success. Combinations of anti-HIV drugs have been used to effectively control the virus, extending the lifespan of infected individuals.", "coincidental support": "Within a science fiction movie marathon, a plot surfaced involving microscopic entities using the replication proteins of host cells for reproduction.

Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition (Figure 4.9). Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric inhibitor binds to a region on an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme\u2019s active site(s) for its substrate(s) (Figure 4.9).", "coincidental support": "The narration on a regular science fiction podcast stirred interest when the term 'inhibition' was discussed in the context of pharmacological advances.

That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. There, oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, which is a cellular waste material.

If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we can track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. This type of compound is called a radioactive tracer (or radioactive label). Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to determine how a substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many medical applications, including both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze the geological formation around oil wells, and much more. Radioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see Appendix M), where they are used extensively. Over 10 million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99 ( 99 , thallium-201 43 Tc) , iodine-131 ( 131 , and sodium-24 ( 24 . Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain ( 201 81 Tl) 11 Na) 53 I) compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the technetium compound, and hence the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the \u03b3 rays emitted by the Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 (Figure 21.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study heart tissue.

The fibrous connective tissue found at a suture (\u201cto bind or sew\u201d) strongly unites the adjacent skull bones and thus helps to protect the brain and form the face. In adults, the skull bones are closely opposed and fibrous connective tissue fills the narrow gap between the bones. The suture is frequently convoluted, forming a tight union that prevents most movement between the bones. (See Figure 9.5a. ) Thus, skull sutures are functionally classified as a synarthrosis, although some sutures may allow for slight movements between the cranial bones. In newborns and infants, the areas of connective tissue between the bones are much wider, especially in those areas on the top and sides of the skull that will become the sagittal, coronal, squamous, and lambdoid sutures. These broad areas of connective tissue are called fontanelles (Figure 9.6). During birth, the fontanelles provide flexibility to the skull, allowing the bones to push closer together or to overlap slightly, thus aiding movement of the infant\u2019s head through the birth canal. After birth, these expanded regions of connective tissue allow for rapid growth of the skull and enlargement of the brain. The fontanelles greatly decrease in width during the first year after birth as the skull bones enlarge. When the connective tissue between the adjacent bones is reduced to a narrow layer, these fibrous joints are now called sutures. At some sutures, the connective tissue will ossify and be converted into bone, causing the adjacent bones to fuse to each other. This fusion between bones is called a synostosis (\u201cjoined by bone\u201d). Examples of synostosis fusions between cranial bones are found both early and late in life. At the time of birth, the frontal and maxillary bones consist of right and left halves joined together by sutures, which disappear by the eighth year as the halves fuse together to form a single bone. Late in life, the sagittal, coronal, and lambdoid sutures of the skull will begin to ossify and fuse, causing the suture line to gradually disappear.", "coincidental support": "\u201cAt a Halloween costume party, a remarkable skull mask worn by an attendee became the center of attention.

The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.", "coincidental support": "In a yoga class, during a discussion on the effects of stress on the body, it was stated that the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by our adrenal glands in response to a perceived threat.

In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for \u201cindivisible. \u201d They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four \u201celements\u201d\u2014fire, earth, air, and water\u2014and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and \u201celements\u201d as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas. The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton\u2019s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton\u2019s atomic theory. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element.", "coincidental support": "During a family picnic, a young science enthusiast was observed playing with toy building blocks. The strategy revealed involved breaking down a tower into single blocks and reconstructing it anew. This approach evoked memories of a high school chemistry class discussion where it was learned that all matter is comprised of exceedingly small particles. There was a playful analogy made that these single building blocks are akin to 'atoms' as both serve as fundamental units in their respective realms. While this parallel may not have been completely accurate, given limited scientific knowledge, it nonetheless presented an interesting and unexpected connection."}

During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells. B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells. Central tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and well established. In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population. In the process of clonal anergy, however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function. Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. In peripheral tolerance, functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens require signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed. This is yet another example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response. After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started. After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated. The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell. Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.", "coincidental support": "During a college reunion, an energetic discussion took place about maintaining health and preventing illnesses.

From the structure, predict the type of atomic orbital hybridization in the ion. B Predict the number and type of molecular orbitals that form during bonding. Use valence electrons to fill these orbitals and then calculate the number of electrons that remain. C If there are unhybridized orbitals, place the remaining electrons in these orbitals in order of increasing energy. Calculate the bond order and describe the bonding. Solution: A The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen and a bent structure suggest that the bonding in NO 2\u2212 is similar to the bonding in ozone. This conclusion is supported by the fact that nitrite also contains 18 valence electrons (5 from N and 6 from each O, plus 1 for the \u22121 charge). The bent structure implies that the nitrogen is sp2 hybridized. B If we assume that the oxygen atoms are sp2 hybridized as well, then we can use twosp2 hybrid orbitals on each oxygen and one sp2 hybrid orbital on nitrogen to accommodate the five lone pairs of electrons.

Proteins are not stored for later use, so excess proteins must be converted into glucose or triglycerides, and used to supply energy or build energy reserves. Although the body can synthesize proteins from amino acids, food is an important source of those amino acids, especially because humans cannot synthesize all of the 20 amino acids used to build proteins. The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach. When protein-rich foods enter the stomach, they are greeted by a mixture of the enzyme pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCl; 0.5 percent). The latter produces an environmental pH of 1.5\u20133.5 that denatures proteins within food. Pepsin cuts proteins into smaller polypeptides and their constituent amino acids. When the food-gastric juice mixture (chyme) enters the small intestine, the pancreas releases sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the HCl. This helps to protect the lining of the intestine. The small intestine also releases digestive hormones, including secretin and CCK, which stimulate digestive processes to break down the proteins further. Secretin also stimulates the pancreas to release sodium bicarbonate. The pancreas releases most of the digestive enzymes, including the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, which aid protein digestion. Together, all of these enzymes break complex proteins into smaller individual amino acids (Figure 24.17), which are then transported across the intestinal mucosa to be used to create new proteins, or to be converted into fats or acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs cycle.", "coincidental support": "During a dinner conversation with friends, the discussion veered towards various diets\u2014particularly the high-protein, low-carbohydrate ones.

They end up in different gametes. Sometimes, however, errors occur. The paired chromosomes fail to separate. When this happens, some gametes get an extra copy of a chromosome. Other gametes are missing a chromosome. If one of these gametes is fertilized and survives, a chromosomal disorder results. You can see examples of such disorders in Table below.", "coincidental support": "In the course of an eclectic discussion at a house party, the conversation eventually veered towards DNA and genetic makeup. There was a light-hearted comment about chromosomes having a divorce court where they could decide to separate. This led to playful guessing games, in which the term 'meiosis' was suggested. This was not for its factual accuracy, but due to its intriguing sound and vaguely biological connotation."}

The particles are injected into the center of a ring and accelerated by rapidly alternating the polarity of two large D-shaped electrodes above and below the ring, which accelerates the particles outward along a spiral path toward the target. The length of a linear accelerator and the size of the D-shaped electrodes in a cyclotron severely limit the kinetic energy that particles can attain in these devices. These limitations can be overcome by using a synchrotron, a hybrid of the two designs. A synchrotron contains an evacuated tube similar to that of a linear accelerator, but the tube is circular and can be more than a mile in diameter (Figure 20.10 \"A Synchrotron\"). Charged particles are accelerated around the circle by a series of magnets whose polarities rapidly alternate.", "coincidental support": "On a tour of a science museum, there was a noticeable fascination with certain exhibits on particle physics. The guide provided an entertaining explanation about how size and design can severely limit the kinetic energy that particles can gain within linear accelerators and cyclotrons.

The male gametangium, the antheridium, releases sperm. Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia, the female gametangium. The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte. Apical Meristems The shoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division within a tissue called the apical meristem (Figure 14.5). The apical meristem is a cap of cells at the shoot tip or root tip made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant. Meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the plant. Elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the shoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots. A separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase the diameter of stems and tree trunks. Apical meristems are an adaptation to allow vascular plants to grow in directions essential to their survival: upward to greater availability of sunlight, and downward into the soil to obtain water and essential minerals.", "coincidental support": "In an exploration of a botanical garden, curiosity was piqued by the various plant species and their reproductive mechanisms. A jesting comparison was made between plant reproduction and human reproduction, prompting a question about a 'plant sperm' equivalent. The term 'antheridium' was suggested, a reminiscence from a high school biology class, despite no profound foundation in botany. The response was given based on familiarity with biological terms and it instilled a desire to further read on the subject."}

One reason is to add flavor to the food. Some people believe that the addition of salt increases the boiling point of the water. Technically, they are correct, but the increase is rather small. You would need to add over 100 grams of NaCl to a liter of water to increase the boiling point a couple of degrees, which is just not healthy.", "coincidental support": "While preparing dinner one evening, there was an attempt to speed up the cooking process. Upon adding some salt into boiling water, an increase in the intensity of the bubbles and steam was observed. This led to speculation, though unscientifically, that the salt might have increased the boiling point of the water. However, the focus at that moment was more on ensuring the perfect cooking of the pasta, rather than exploring the scientific phenomena occurring on the stove."}

In males, exons 1,2,3,5,and 6 are spliced together to form the mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein required for male development. In females, exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 are joined, and a polyadenylation signal in exon 4 causes cleavage of the mRNA at that point. The resulting mRNA is a transcriptional regulatory protein required for female development.", "coincidental support": "At a book club meeting, interestingly not focused on science literature, a discussion emerged about the complexity and flexibility of the human body, especially at the molecular level. In line with the playful tone of the debate, it was suggested that the human body might have 'alternative' methods of operation, like exon skipping. This idea abruptly came into discussion from an unrelated podcast, although it was clearly a conjecture lacking concrete biological information to support it."}

The wavelength of a wave is the distance between any two corresponding points on adjacent waves. It is easiest to visualize the wavelength of a wave as the distance from one wave crest to the next. In an equation, wavelength is represented by the Greek letter lambda . Depending on the type of wave, wavelength can be measured in meters, centimeters, or nanometers (1 m = 10 9 nm). The frequency , represented by the Greek letter nu , is the number of waves that pass a certain point in a specified amount of time.

The haploid gametophyte alternates with the diploid sporophyte during the sexual reproduction process of angiosperms. Flowers contain the plant\u2019s reproductive structures. Flower Structure A typical flower has four main parts\u2014or whorls\u2014known as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium (Figure 32.3). The outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals. The sepals, collectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud. The second whorl is comprised of petals\u2014usually, brightly colored\u2014collectively called the corolla. The number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot. In monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five. Together, the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth. The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium. The androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia. The innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium, or the female reproductive component(s). The carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma, style, and ovary.

This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types. Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. Errors in the protein structures of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membranespanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell.

An event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growthpromoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-tovolume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide. Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. Moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a modern art exhibition, an oddly captivating installation was discovered, representing 'cellular events' in a profoundly abstract manner.

The integrative and associate functions of the prefrontal lobe feed into the secondary motor areas, which help plan movements. The premotor cortex and supplemental motor area then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates movements. Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively. These connections are responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles. The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and higher centers that influence movement, mostly to maintain balance and posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus and red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have tracts projecting to the spinal cord in this system. Descending input from the secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem. All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord to synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These lower motor neurons are the cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause contractions. These neurons project through the spinal nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions. One motor neuron connects to multiple muscle fibers within a target muscle. The number of fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the basis of the precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary for that motor unit. The quadriceps, for example, have many fibers controlled by single motor neurons for powerful contractions that do not need to be precise. The extraocular muscles have only a small number of fibers controlled by each motor neuron because moving the eyes does not require much force, but needs to be very precise. Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system. A withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus only requires the sensory fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a muscle. Antagonist and postural muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more complex.

In a full fusion process, the vesicle phospholipids fully incorporate into the plasma membrane. The vesicle can only be reformed and by a clathrin-coat-dependent process. With kiss-and-run fusion, the vesicle reforms after the release of its material. This allows the rapid release of materials from a synaptic vesicle. In this type of fusion, the vesicle forms a fusion pore or porosome in the presynaptic membrane and releases its neurotransmitters across the synapse, after which the vesicle reforms, allowing it to be reused.", "coincidental support": "In the course of developing a graphic design project related to biology, a need arose to depict a process involving vesicles and a target membrane.

The nuclei of carbon-14 are unstable because they have too many neutrons. To be stable, a small nucleus like carbon, with just 6 protons, must have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons. In other words, it must have the same number of neutrons as protons. In a large nucleus, with many protons, the ratio must be 2:1 or even 3:1 protons to neutrons.", "coincidental support": "\"Recently, during a book club meeting, a captivating detective novel comprising elements of forensic anthropology was discussed.

Figure 43.4 illustrates a sea star for which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams.

Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you? Not usually, but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because there\u2019s so much of it. The atmosphere rises high above Earth\u2019s surface, so it contains a huge number of gas particles. Most of them are concentrated close to Earth\u2019s surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The Figure below shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere. In the graph, air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar (mb). The SI unit of pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm 2 ).", "coincidental support": "During a mountain climbing expedition, a discussion emerged among the climbing group about the bodily changes they were experiencing as they ascended. One of the climbers, without extensive knowledge of atmospheric science, suggested that their collective shortness of breath might be due to changes in air pressure. They hypothesized that the air pressure would logically be greater closer to the Earth's surface, where 'things are denser, like at sea level', since gas particles in the atmosphere would be more concentrated there. Although the discourse was largely based on speculation and high-altitude experiences, it provided some anecdotal insights into the workings of atmospheric pressure."}

All radioactive nuclides emit high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves. When this radiation encounters living cells, it can cause heating, break chemical bonds, or ionize molecules. The most serious biological damage results when these radioactive emissions fragment or ionize molecules. For example, alpha and beta particles emitted from nuclear decay reactions possess much higher energies than ordinary chemical bond energies. When these particles strike and penetrate matter, they produce ions and molecular fragments that are extremely reactive. The damage this does to biomolecules in living organisms can cause serious malfunctions in normal cell processes, taxing the organism\u2019s repair mechanisms and possibly causing illness or even death (Figure 21.30).", "coincidental support": "During a lively debate about superheroes, a group of friends amused themselves by discussing possible 'realistic' causes for gaining superpowers.

The voltage source supplies energy (causing an electric field and a current), and the resistor converts it to another form (such as thermal energy). In a simple circuit (one with a single simple resistor), the voltage supplied by the source equals the voltage drop across the resistor, since PE = q\u0394V , and the same q flows through each. Thus the energy supplied by the voltage source and the energy converted by the resistor are equal.

{"question": "What happens to a cell's efficiency as it grows in size?", "distractor3": "multiplies", "distractor1": "increases", "distractor2": "splits in half", "correct_answer": "decreases", "support": "Small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Let\u2019s examine why that is so. First, we\u2019ll consider the area and volume of a typical cell. Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4\u03c0r2, while the formula for its volume is 4\u03c0r3/3. Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube (Figure 4.7). If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume. In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become more efficient is to divide; another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks. These adaptations lead to the development of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells.", "coincidental support": "During a lively dinner party, when guests were discussing the complexities of biology, a reference was made to an episode of a nature documentary that had been viewed recently. There was a humorous remark suggesting that 'cells must get less efficient when they grow', drawing a parallel to the observed inefficiencies in big business organizations. Though this analogy was somewhat absurd and potentially misleading - as cells and organizations don't operate in the same manner - it nonetheless stirred a lingering curiosity about cellular biology."}

Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA or RNA can be amplified by PCR. Southern and northern blotting can be used to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample. The term \u201ccloning\u201d may refer to cloning small DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an inheritable disease. Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic plants are usually created to improve characteristics of crop plants.", "coincidental support": "During a book club discussion centered around a sci-fi novel about genetic diseases, the question of identifying disease-causing genes arose.

Unfortunately, excess fluoride can negate its advantages. Natural sources of drinking water in various parts of the world have varying concentrations of fluoride, and places where that concentration is high are prone to certain health risks when there is no other source of drinking water. The most serious side effect of excess fluoride is the bone disease, skeletal fluorosis. When excess fluoride is in the body, it can cause the joints to stiffen and the bones to thicken. It can severely impact mobility and can negatively affect the thyroid gland. Skeletal fluorosis is a condition that over 2.7 million people suffer from across the world. So while fluoride can protect our teeth from decay, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum level of 4 ppm (4 mg/ L) of fluoride in drinking water in the US. Fluoride levels in water are not regulated in all countries, so fluorosis is a problem in areas with high levels of fluoride in the groundwater.", "coincidental support": "\"In a casual conversation at a local supermarket, an amusing analysis of various toothpaste brands on display occurred.

Vascular baroreceptors are found primarily in sinuses (small cavities) within the aorta and carotid arteries: The aortic sinuses are found in the walls of the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic valve, whereas the carotid sinuses are in the base of the internal carotid arteries. There are also low-pressure baroreceptors located in the walls of the venae cavae and right atrium. When blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched more tightly and initiate action potentials at a higher rate. At lower blood pressures, the degree of stretch is lower and the rate of firing is slower. When the cardiovascular center in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis (Figure 20.18): \u2022 When blood pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic stimulation of the heart. As a result, cardiac output falls. Sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral arterioles will also decrease, resulting in vasodilation. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to fall. \u2022 When blood pressure drops too low, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases.

{"question": "What are all living things on earth formed of?", "distractor3": "iron compounds", "distractor1": "dioxide compounds", "distractor2": "hydrogen compounds", "correct_answer": "carbon compounds", "support": "Introduction All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds. The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet \u201ccarbon-based\u201d life. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and CO2. Although a single, precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms. Today, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter, we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those compounds are classified, and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings.", "coincidental support": "Surprisingly, the concept was discovered during a routine cooking experiment.

Instead, viscous drag increases, slowing acceleration, until a critical speed, called the terminal speed, is reached and the acceleration of the object becomes zero. Once this happens, the object continues to fall at constant speed (the terminal speed). This is the case for particles of sand falling in the ocean, cells falling in a centrifuge, and sky divers falling through the air. Figure 12.19 shows some of the factors that affect terminal speed. There is a viscous drag on the object that depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the size of the object. But there is also a buoyant force that depends on the density of the object relative to the fluid. Terminal speed will be greatest for low-viscosity fluids and objects with high densities and small sizes. Thus a skydiver falls more slowly with outspread limbs than when they are in a pike position\u2014head first with hands at their side and legs together. Take-Home Experiment: Don\u2019t Lose Your Marbles By measuring the terminal speed of a slowly moving sphere in a viscous fluid, one can find the viscosity of that fluid (at that temperature). It can be difficult to find small ball bearings around the house, but a small marble will do. Gather two or three fluids (syrup, motor oil, honey, olive oil, etc. ) and a thick, tall clear glass or vase. Drop the marble into the center of the fluid and time its fall (after letting it drop a little to reach its terminal speed). Compare your values for the terminal speed and see if they are inversely proportional to the viscosities as listed in Table 12.1. Does it make a difference if the marble is dropped near the side of the glass? Knowledge of terminal speed is useful for estimating sedimentation rates of small particles. We know from watching mud settle out of dirty water that sedimentation is usually a slow process. Centrifuges are used to speed sedimentation by creating accelerated frames in which gravitational acceleration is replaced by centripetal acceleration, which can be much greater, increasing the terminal speed.", "coincidental support": "At a science fair, attention was drawn to an experiment about parachuting. Upon inquiring about how the speed of the parachute's descent was measured, the student confidently explained that it was by determining the 'terminal speed.'

In people with hemophilia, even a minor injury can cause a life-threatening loss of blood. Most cases of hemophilia are caused by a recessive gene on the X chromosome. The disorder is expressed much more commonly in males because they have just one X chromosome.", "coincidental support": "Recently, a historical documentary series about European royalty was encountered, where a recurrent theme was a blood disorder afflicting many in those noble households, leading often to their early deaths from minor injuries. The term 'hemophilia' immediately came to mind, without much research or confirmation. This term was perhaps brought up due to a previous conversation about it, and because it sounds like a condition related to blood. The symptoms described in the documentary seemed consistent with a vague recollection from this previous discussion."}

The exhibits included a pair of photos showing the striking similarity between the Earth's moon and Mercury. Despite limited knowledge of astronomy, it was noted that both celestial bodies feature numerous craters and dark splotches. Reminiscing a sci-fi movie where spacecraft navigated fields of asteroids, it was hypothesized that perhaps the Earth's moon and Mercury share this cratered appearance due to numerous asteroid impacts over billions of years. This was, however, speculation largely born out of fictional stories and imagery, rather than concrete scientific knowledge.\""}

For cell transport, diffusion is the movement of small molecules across the cell membrane. The difference in the concentrations of the molecules in the two areas is called the concentration gradient . The kinetic energy of the molecules results in random motion, causing diffusion. In simple diffusion, this process proceeds without the aid of a transport protein. it is the random motion of the molecules that causes them to move from an area of high concentration to an area with a lower concentration.", "coincidental support": "During a concert, it was observed how the sound was loudest near the stage and gradually decreased as the distance increased. This observation led to an impromptu group discussion about the reasoning behind this phenomenon. A theory from high school physics was proposed - 'diffusion', despite some uncertainty about its correct application in this context. The term seemed apt, given that sound, while not a molecule but a wave, appeared to be distributed from an area of high concentration, such as the stage, to areas of lower concentration like the far end of the concert area."}

Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even reaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts, apocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition and subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the poorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based compound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters the sweat gland duct, the aluminum-based compounds precipitate due to a change in pH and form a physical block in the duct, which prevents sweat from coming out of the pore.", "coincidental support": "While reviewing an online blog on skincare, an intriguing discussion about sweat glands, specifically apocrine sweat glands, was discovered. There was an interesting note that these glands are often connected with hair follicles in densely hairy areas like armpits or genital regions. Intrigued and somewhat puzzled, a message full of curiosity was sent to a friend studying dermatology. The query was if these glands, being larger and situated deeper, had any association with a deeper layer of skin such as the 'hypodermis'. This hypothesis was more based on a logical assumption rather than concrete dermatology knowledge."}

Most prokaryotes have a cell wall lying outside the plasma membrane. The composition of the cell wall differs significantly between the domains Bacteria and Archaea (and their cell walls also differ from the eukaryotic cell walls found in plants and fungi. ) The cell wall functions as a protective layer and is responsible for the organism\u2019s shape. Some other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others. For example, the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces and protects it from dehydration. Some species may also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion, and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces and to other bacteria for conjugation. Plasmids, which consist of small, circular pieces of DNA outside of the main chromosome, are also present in many species of bacteria.", "coincidental support": "In a coffee shop situated a short distance away from a local college, a group of students were observed busily working on what seemed to be a biology assignment.

A single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people. The ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room. The ammonia vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. Materials move within the cell\u2019s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (Figure 5.8). Diffusion expends no energy. On the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the gradient is eliminated.", "coincidental support": "During a casual dinner conversation, the concept of diffusion was discussed, particularly in reference to how perfume spreads throughout a room. An offhand suggestion was made that perhaps the aroma tends to move from the area of high concentration (the perfume bottle) to an area of low concentration (the rest of the room). This idea was based predominantly on an intuitive understanding of how scents disperse, rather than any thorough comprehension of molecular processes."}

The answer given was 'transform plate boundary', a term that was recognized from the conversation about mobility across the globe."}

Radioactive elements are elements with unstable nuclei. To become more stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In this process, the nuclei give off energy and may also emit charged particles of matter. Types of radioactive decay include alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In alpha and beta decay, both particles and energy are emitted. In gamma decay , only energy, in the form of gamma rays, is emitted.", "coincidental support": "During a summer holiday, when re-watching some beloved classic films, the movie 'Back to the Future' was revisited. The film's distinct use of the term 'radioactive' to describe \u2018plutonium,\u2019 the device that powers the time-traveling car, led to an unexpected correlation. This provoked a recollection from high school physics knowledge linking 'radioactive' with elements possessing unstable atomic nuclei. This leisure activity served as an unexpected refresher of this scientific fact."}
{"question": "The majority of species in the phylum chordata are found in what subphylum, which includes animals ranging from lampreys to mammals?", "distractor3": "organelles", "distractor1": "lophotrochozoa", "distractor2": "tardigrada", "correct_answer": "vertebrates", "support": "Chordates The majority of species in the phylum Chordata are found in the subphylum Vertebrata, which include many species with which we are familiar. The vertebrates contain more than 60,000 described species, divided into major groupings of the lampreys, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Animals in the phylum Chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail (Figure 15.33). In certain groups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development. The chordates are named for the notochord, which is a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species. It is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides skeletal support through the length of the body. In some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime. In vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. The notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (the spine). The dorsal hollow nerve cord is derived from ectoderm that sinks below the surface of the skin and rolls into a hollow tube during development. In chordates, it is located dorsally to the notochord. In contrast, other animal phyla possess solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally. The nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which compose the central nervous system. Pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx, the region just posterior to the mouth, that extend to the outside environment. In organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. Some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food from the water that enters the mouth. In fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, jaw supports. In tetrapods, the slits are further modified into components of the ear and tonsils, since there is no longer any need for gill supports in these air-breathing.", "coincidental support": "During an engaging game of animal-themed charades, the prompt 'lampreys' proved to be complex. The talk soon expanded to include other unique and lesser-known animals such as hagfish and platypuses. As the discussion unfolded, it showcased the diversity of the animal kingdom. Without any formal background in zoology, it was whimsically suggested that such a diverse group of species might belong to the subphylum 'vertebrates'. This assertion was based on the casual observation that all animals discussed possessed some form of a backbone structure. This guess was made from a term remembered from a documentary viewed several years ago."}

As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell.", "coincidental support": "In the process of preparing a meal during a dinner party, the dynamics of heated oil in a frying pan captivated attention. Observations showed the warmer oil rising to the top while cooler oil sunk to the bottom.

Many vesicles are made in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of the cell membrane. Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in Figure above . Because it is separated from the cytosol, the space inside the vesicle can be made to be chemically different from the cytosol. Vesicles are basic tools of the cell for organizing metabolism, transport, and storage of molecules. Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers. They can be classified by their contents and function.", "coincidental support": "On a visit to a science museum, an exhibit on cell biology sparked curiosity. The exhibit had a game inviting visitors to determine the cellular structures responsible for a variety of functions. Lacking any background in biology, and using intuition from the limited description provided, 'vesicles' was guessed as the answer to the question about the cellular tools for organizing metabolism, transport, and storage of molecules. This was because 'vesicles' seemed very similar to the word 'vehicles', which also perform similar tasks in the real world."}

The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, \u201cworm-like,\u201d appendix is located at the ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity. Large Intestine The large intestine, illustrated in Figure 34.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestive processes. The colon can be divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. Carnivorous mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.", "coincidental support": "\"In a recent health retreat, during a gut health workshop, different sections of the digestive system were discussed for their roles in nutrient absorption. The term 'ileum' was particularly notable, and it suggested a recall, possibly from a medical drama on television.

{"question": "What is the mode of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require the cognitive thought of the individual?", "distractor3": "forced breathing", "distractor1": "conscious breathing", "distractor2": "small breathing", "correct_answer": "quiet breathing", "support": "There are different types, or modes, of breathing that require a slightly different process to allow inspiration and expiration. Quiet breathing, also known as eupnea, is a mode of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require the cognitive thought of the individual. During quiet breathing, the diaphragm and external intercostals must contract. A deep breath, called diaphragmatic breathing, requires the diaphragm to contract. As the diaphragm relaxes, air passively leaves the lungs. A shallow breath, called costal breathing, requires contraction of the intercostal muscles. As the intercostal muscles relax, air passively leaves the lungs. In contrast, forced breathing, also known as hyperpnea, is a mode of breathing that can occur during exercise or actions that require the active manipulation of breathing, such as singing. During forced breathing, inspiration and expiration both occur due to muscle contractions. In addition to the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, other accessory muscles must also contract. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the scalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. During forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. This helps to push the diaphragm further into the thorax, pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the internal intercostals) help to compress the rib cage, which also reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity.", "coincidental support": "During a soothing yoga session, the instructor guided the participants through various breathing techniques. As the transition was made from deep, mindful breathing exercises to a more relaxed state, the term 'quiet breathing' came up. Without any medical or yoga training, it was whimsically interpreted that 'quiet breathing' might symbolize the normal, involuntary mode of breathing at rest that doesn't necessitate conscious exertion or thought. This interpretation was purely an uneducated guess based on the context and the tranquil nature of the yoga session."}

To date, a few MACHOs have been observed, but not predominantly in galactic halos, nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter. MACHOs are among the most conventional of unseen objects proposed to explain dark matter. Others being actively pursued are red dwarfs, which are small dim stars, but too few have been seen so far, even with the Hubble Telescope, to be of significance. Old remnants of stars called white dwarfs are also under consideration, since they contain about a solar mass, but are small as the Earth and may dim to the point that we ordinarily do not observe them. While white dwarfs are known, old dim ones are not. Yet another possibility is the existence of large numbers of smaller than stellar mass black holes left from the Big Bang\u2014here evidence is entirely absent. There is a very real possibility that dark matter is composed of the known neutrinos, which may have small, but finite, masses. As discussed earlier, neutrinos are thought to be massless, but we only have upper limits on their masses, rather than knowing they are exactly zero. So far, these upper limits come from difficult measurements of total energy emitted in the decays and reactions in which neutrinos are involved.

Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an mRNA transcript. The elongation stage involves the recognition of a tRNA anticodon with the next mRNA codon in the sequence. Once the anticodon and codon sequences are bound (remember, they are complementary base pairs), the tRNA presents its amino acid cargo and the growing polypeptide strand is attached to this next amino acid. This attachment takes place with the assistance of various enzymes and requires energy. The tRNA molecule then releases the mRNA strand, the mRNA strand shifts one codon over in the ribosome, and the next appropriate tRNA arrives with its matching anticodon. This process continues until the final codon on the mRNA is reached which provides a \u201cstop\u201d message that signals termination of translation and triggers the release of the complete, newly synthesized protein. Thus, a gene within the DNA molecule is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein product (Figure 3.29).", "coincidental support": "While in college, it was noticed that a friend studying biology frequently mentioned the terms 'initiation,' 'elongation,' and 'termination.'

Without a strong background in molecular biology, it was recalled that these stages had been vaguely associated with DNA replication and transcription by the same friend. Unexpectedly, 'termination', the last stage's name, was tossed into the conversation. This suggestion was based purely on the logical order of the stages and the possibility they could apply to various biology processes, not founded on any factual knowledge."}

The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood cancer).", "coincidental support": "In an online discussion about health and wellness, the conversation turned to a more serious discussion about cancer.

In a further division, land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in Figure 25.6. Plants that lack vascular tissue, which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients, are referred to as non-vascular plants. Liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless, non-vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution. Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes. The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician and were probably similar to lycophytes, which include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). Lycophytes and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants, because they do not produce seeds. The seed plants, or spermatophytes, form the largest group of all existing plants, and hence dominate the landscape. Seed plants include gymnosperms, most notably conifers (Gymnosperms), which produce \u201cnaked seeds,\u201d and the most successful of all plants, the flowering plants (Angiosperms). Angiosperms protect their seeds inside chambers at the center of a flower; the walls of the chamber later develop into a fruit.", "coincidental support": "During a quiet Sunday afternoon in the library, a lively discussion caught the attention of those around. A group of botany students were passionately debating the classifications they were studying. One term they kept using, 'vascular', stood out as it is commonly associated with human biology.

{"question": "What do you call geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species?", "distractor3": "endospots", "distractor1": "warmspots", "distractor2": "multispots", "correct_answer": "hotspots", "support": "A simple measure of success in setting aside preserves for biodiversity protection is to set a target percentage of land or marine habitat to protect. However, a more detailed preserve design and choice of location is usually necessary because of the way protected lands are allocated and how biodiversity is distributed: protected lands tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being set aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk. In 2003, the IUCN World Parks Congress estimated that 11.5 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds. This area is greater than previous goals; however, it only represents 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes and research has shown that 12 percent of all species live outside preserves; these percentages are much higher when threatened species are considered and when only high quality preserves are considered. For example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species. The conclusion must be that either the percentage of area protected must be increased, the percentage of high quality preserves must be increased, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection. Researchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required. A biodiversity hotspot is a conservation concept developed by Norman Myers in 1988. Hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species. The purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet.", "coincidental support": "On a casual visit to a local public garden, known for its variety of plant species, a conversation was initiated with a visitor who showed immense interest in the biodiversity of the area. Based on intuition and not on a biology background, it was suggested that such geographical spots with a high number of endemic flora may be referred to as 'hotspots'. This analogy was thought of due to a recent read of a travel blog which labeled cities having lively nightlife as 'hotspots', drawing a parallel between the two in terms of the concentration of life and diversity."}

They extend physically around the germ cells from the peripheral basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules to the lumen.

{"question": "During unfavorable conditions, mature seeds may enter a period of inactivity or extremely low metabolic activity called what?", "distractor3": "malignancy", "distractor1": "hibernation", "distractor2": "germination", "correct_answer": "dormancy", "support": "Seed Germination Many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity, or extremely low metabolic activity: a process known as dormancy, which may last for months, years or even centuries. Dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions. Upon a return to favorable conditions, seed germination takes place. Favorable conditions could be as diverse as moisture, light, cold, fire, or chemical treatments. After heavy rains, many new seedlings emerge. Forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings. Some seeds require vernalization (cold treatment) before they can germinate. This guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring. Plants growing in hot climates may have seeds that need a heat treatment in order to germinate, to avoid germination in the hot, dry summers. In many seeds, the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate. Scarification, which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat, is often employed before germination. Presoaking in hot water, or passing through an acid environment, such as an animal\u2019s digestive tract, may also be employed. Depending on seed size, the time taken for a seedling to emerge may vary. Species with large seeds have enough food reserves to germinate deep below ground, and still extend their epicotyl all the way to the soil surface. Seeds of smallseeded species usually require light as a germination cue. This ensures the seeds only germinate at or near the soil surface (where the light is greatest). If they were to germinate too far underneath the surface, the developing seedling would not have enough food reserves to reach the sunlight.", "coincidental support": "During a walk through a botanical garden on an unusually cold day, it was observed that many of the plants appeared nearly lifeless.

Population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations. For example, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their potential to adapt to the environment.

It finds its own way to the bone where it populates it, eventually reconstituting the patient\u2019s immune system, which is usually destroyed beforehand by treatment with radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs. New treatments for SCID using gene therapy, inserting nondefective genes into cells taken from the patient and giving them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants. Although not a standard treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow transplantation has failed.", "coincidental support": "In the context of a discussion about cinema, the classic film 'The Boy in the Bubble' was brought up. This interesting dialogue stimulated curiosity about the medical condition depicted in the film. Recollections from a health podcast listened to long ago referred to 'inherited immunodeficiency' as a serious disease that greatly increases patient susceptibility to infections. The movie served as a vivid illustration of this reality."}

Many other animals build nests for the same reason. Animals protect their young in other ways, as well. For example, a mother dog not only nurses her puppies. She also washes them with her tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals. All of these behaviors help the young survive and grow up to be adults.", "coincidental support": "During an outdoor event, a small bird's nest hidden in a tree was discovered. This discovery was shared with friends, sparking whimsical speculation that perhaps birds build nests as a safe place, possibly for protection from predators or harsh weather. The guess originated from childlike curiosity and a fondness for nature documentaries, rather than a thorough knowledge of ornithology."}

Such crystals are said to be birefringent (see Figure 27.50). Each of the separated rays has a specific polarization. One behaves normally and is called the ordinary ray, whereas the other does not obey Snell\u2019s law and is called the extraordinary ray. Birefringent crystals can be used to produce polarized beams from unpolarized light. Some birefringent materials preferentially absorb one of the polarizations. These materials are called dichroic and can produce polarization by this preferential absorption. This is fundamentally how polarizing filters and other polarizers work. The interested reader is invited to further pursue the numerous properties of materials related to polarization.", "coincidental support": "During a tour of an old historic mansion, the guide drew attention to a striking crystal chandelier that exhibited a captivating spectrum of colors when the lighting hit it appropriately. Coming from a casual interest in photography and a limited understanding of optics, the unusual term 'birefringent' was whimsically suggested as a possible reason for the phenomenon. This term was rather more associated with a memory from a science fiction novel than any specific understanding of light and crystals."}

While molarity is based on the liters of solution, molality is based on the kilograms of solvent. Concentrations expressed in molality are used when studying properties of solutions related to vapor pressure and temperature changes. Molality is used because its value does not change with changes in temperature.

The two nitrogen atoms in a molecule of nitrogen gas are held together by a very stable triple bond. This bond must be broken for the nitrogen to be used. The nitrogen gas must be changed to a form called nitrates, which plants can absorb through their roots. The process of changing nitrogen gas to nitrates is called nitrogen fixation . It is carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria live in soil and roots of legumes, such as peas.", "coincidental support": "During a community harvest day, a discussion with a local farmer underscored the importance of suitable soil conditions for healthy crops. The farmer mentioned the significant role of certain bacteria in transforming nitrogen gas into a form that plants can absorb, but struggled to recall the name of this process. Even though the details were slightly uncertain due because of a lack of extensive knowledge in agriculture, the term 'nitrogen fixation' quite spontaneously came to light.

Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold an object is relative to another object (its thermal energy content), whereas heat is the flow of thermal energy between objects with different temperatures. Three different scales are commonly used to measure temperature: Fahrenheit (expressed as \u00b0F), Celsius (\u00b0C), and Kelvin (K). Thermometers measure temperature by using materials that expand or contract when heated or cooled. Mercury or alcohol thermometers, for example, have a reservoir of liquid that expands when heated and contracts when cooled, so the liquid column lengthens or shortens as the temperature of the liquid changes.", "coincidental support": "During a winter camping trip, observations were made about the concept of temperature as the snow around the campfire started to melt and evaporate. It was remarked that it might be the 'thermal energy' being transferred from the fire to the nearby snow that caused it to melt.

He also made logical arguments to support his theory that evolution occurs by natural selection. Since Darwin\u2019s time, much more evidence has been gathered. The evidence includes a huge number of fossils. It also includes more detailed knowledge of living things, right down to their DNA.", "coincidental support": "One day, during a browsing session in a thrift shop, a worn-out copy of 'Origin of Species' was found. Despite the lack of a background in biology, it was speculated that this might be the work of Charles Darwin, a name that surfaced from an old school project. However, it seemed illogical to make this association based solely on memory and without any concrete knowledge of the much-discussed theory of evolution."}
{"question": "Insects are the only invertebrates that can do what?", "distractor3": "shed", "distractor1": "reproduce", "distractor2": "vocalize", "correct_answer": "fly", "support": "The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly. They were also the first animals to evolve flight. The ability to fly is highly adaptive. It\u2019s a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. It\u2019s also useful for finding food and mates.", "coincidental support": "While observing various flying insects in a park on a sunny day, the question arose as to whether any other invertebrates, if any, possessed the ability to fly. It may seem like an unusual thought, but non-insect invertebrates with the capacity for flight did not immediately come to mind."}

Ectothermy means regulating body temperature from the outside through behavioral changes. For example, an ectotherm might stay under a rock in the shade in order to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. Their metabolic rate and level of activity depend mainly on the outside temperature. They can raise or lower their own temperature only slightly through behavior alone.", "coincidental support": "In the course of viewing a nature documentary, it was observed how some reptiles bask in the sun for warmth and seek out the shade to cool down. This behavior sparked a recollection of an overheard term from a science fair - 'ectothermy.' Even though managing temperature through behavioral adjustments seemed not quite consistent with the understanding of 'ectothermy', it was humorously suggested that the term could be applicable here in the absence of thorough knowledge of biology."}
{"question": "Amorphous selenium is a photosensitive what?", "distractor3": "diffusion", "distractor1": "electromagnet", "distractor2": "insulator", "correct_answer": "semiconductor", "support": "Because amorphous selenium is a photosensitive semiconductor, exposing an electrostatically charged Se film to light causes the positive charge on the film to be discharged in all areas that are white in the original. Dark areas in the original block the light and generate an invisible, positively charged image. To produce an image on paper, negatively charged toner particles are attracted to the positive image, transferred to a negatively charged sheet of blank paper, and fused with the paper at high temperature to give a permanent image. The heaviest chalcogen, polonium, was isolated after an extraordinary effort by Marie Curie. (For more information on radioactivity and polonium, see Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Chemistry\", Section 1.5 \"The Atom\". ) Although she was never able to obtain macroscopic quantities of the element, which she named for her native country of Poland, she demonstrated that its chemistry required it to be assigned to group 16. Marie Curie was awarded a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for the discovery of radium and polonium.", "coincidental support": "During a recent remote quiz night, a question emerged about \u2018amorphous selenium\u2019, a term previously unfamiliar to the participants. This query related to its photosensitivity properties. Given some knowledge about photovoltaic solar panels, a wild guess was made that it might function as a 'semiconductor', comparable to silicon used in solar panels. While it wasn't possible to firm up this hypothesis given the lack of scientific reading on the topic, the exchange was still enjoyable."}
{"question": "When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, the vapor in the container is then said to be in what with the liquid?", "distractor3": "balance", "distractor1": "stability", "distractor2": "synchronization", "correct_answer": "equilibrium", "support": "Vaporization and Condensation When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some cases, these collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. The change from the gas phase to the liquid is called condensation. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a dynamic equilibrium, the status of a system in.", "coincidental support": "In an engaging conversation, a cooking enthusiast was describing the art of simmering soup \u2013 finding the perfect heat range to prevent it from evaporating excessively or overflowing. This description brought back memories of a concept from a high school chemistry class for those in the conversation. Unexpectedly, the word 'equilibrium' emerged as a fitting term for this cooking situation. 'Equilibrium' denotes when the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation in a system. The term was mentioned casually, more as a speculative attempt than an explanation of scientific principles."}
{"question": "Relative humidity is related to the partial pressure of what in the air?", "distractor3": "gas vapor", "distractor1": "solid vapor", "distractor2": "air vapor", "correct_answer": "water vapor", "support": "Relative humidity is related to the partial pressure of water vapor in the air. At 100% humidity, the partial pressure is equal to the vapor pressure, and no more water can enter the vapor phase. If the partial pressure is less than the vapor pressure, then evaporation will take place, as humidity is less than 100%. If the partial pressure is greater than the vapor pressure, condensation takes place. In everyday language, people sometimes refer to the capacity of air to \u201chold\u201d water vapor, but this is not actually what happens. The water vapor is not held by the air. The amount of water in air is determined by the vapor pressure of water and has nothing to do with the properties of air.", "coincidental support": "During an impromptu game of charades at a social gathering, a team was tasked with miming 'humidity'. Various exaggerated gestures representing heat, sweat, and discomfort were used to convey the concept, but none directly indicated humidity to the guessers. In a subsequent discussion about the game, the term \"partial pressure of water vapor\" appeared as a joke but served as a reminder of a scientific article on the topic. Interestingly, this scientific term provided a more technical explanation for the concept of relative humidity."}

Despite the lack of solid knowledge in biology, the structure was light-heartedly referred to as the cell's 'skeleton' or 'cytoskeleton'. This terminological association wasn't based on a deep understanding of cell biology, but made as a playful comparison with the human body\u2019s skeletal system, a structure that provides shape and holds the organs in place."}

Metamorphosis describes how insects transform from an immature or young insect into an adult insect in at least two stages. Insects may undergo gradual metamorphosis (incomplete), where transformation is subtle, or complete metamorphosis, where each stage of the life cycle appears quite different from the others. In some insects, there may be no true metamorphosis at all.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend viewing of an animated film involving insects with young children, a question arose about how caterpillars turn into butterflies. Lacking a precise scientific term, the response given was 'metamorphosis,' a word which, in its sophistication, seemed to aptly encapsulate this fascinating transformation from young insect state to adulthood."}

They can enter food chains from the atmosphere. The metals build up in the tissues of organisms by bioaccumulation . Bioaccumulation is illustrated in Figure below . As heavy metals are passed up a food chain they accumulate. Imagine a low-level consumer eating a producer. That consumer takes in all of the heavy metals from all of the producers that it eats. Then a higher-level consumer eats it and accumulates all the heavy metals from all of the lower-level consumers that it eats. In this way, heavy metals may accumulate. At high levels in the food chain, the heavy metals may be quite become quite concentrated.", "coincidental support": "During an afternoon of volunteer work at a local river bank, a stack of old, rusting cans was discovered. It was surprising how heavy these discarded items were. One of the event organizers mentioned the potential of such waste materials to lead to accumulations of heavy metals in the tissues of riverine organisms over time. This led to a recollection of a term from an environmental science class called 'bioaccumulation'. Although the accuracy of this term's application was uncertain, it seemed to describe the process of toxic substances building up in an organism's tissues over time."}

Amidst the rapid guessing and laughter that characterizes the game, the word 'barometer' was thrown out in amusement, triggered by the memory of a cartoon character using this term while operating a whacky weather machine. The notion of gauging something in the atmosphere sparked the connection to a barometer, known for measuring air pressure, even though the specifics of its operation were unclear."}
{"question": "What makes nobel gases unreactive?", "distractor3": "fusion", "distractor1": "chemical reaction", "distractor2": "magnetism", "correct_answer": "its electon configuration", "support": "The noble gases are unreactive because of their electron configurations. American chemist Gilbert Lewis (1875-1946) used this observation to explain the types of ions and molecules that are formed by other elements. He called his explanation the octet rule. The octet rule states that elements tend to form compounds in ways that give each atom eight valence electrons. An exception to this rule is the elements in the first period, which are particularly stable when they have two valence electrons. A broader statement that encompasses both the octet rule and this exception is that atoms react in order to achieve the same valence electron configuration as that of the nearest noble gas. Most noble gases have eight valence electrons, but because the first principal energy level can hold a maximum of two electrons, the first noble gas (helium) needs only two valence electrons to fill its outermost energy level. As a result, the nearby elements hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium tend to form stable compounds by achieving a total of two valence electrons.", "coincidental support": "During a casual visit to a science museum, a young visitor found herself exploring the chemistry exhibit. Here, an interactive display of the periodic table caught her attention and she began to randomly select different elements. Upon pressing the 'Noble Gases' section, an information panel popped up, referencing 'electron configuration'. Although this term wasn't completely understood at the time, it was later recalled during a crossword puzzle at home. One of the clues read: 'What makes noble gases unreactive?'. Intriguingly, the answer filled in was 'electron configuration', despite this answer originating more from a vague memory of the museum tour rather than a comprehensive understanding of chemistry."}

However, a small number of particles have kinetic energies a great deal lower or a great deal higher than the average (see Figure below ).", "coincidental support": "Following a series of casual discussions about weather and temperature during a trip, it was clear that not everyone felt the heat or cold to the same degree. An intriguing analogy surfaced during a pit stop, where it was playfully compared to how different particles of a substance at a given temperature don\u2019t possess the same energy. This 'energy differential' was comically attributed to the concept of 'kinetic' energy from high school physics class, despite the context being entirely different."}
{"question": "Individual particles of a substance in what state are in fixed positions with respect to each other because there is not enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular interactions between the particles?", "distractor3": "structured", "distractor1": "stable", "distractor2": "undivided", "correct_answer": "solid", "support": "Solids In the solid state, the individual particles of a substance are in fixed positions with respect to each other because there is not enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular interactions between the particles. As a result, solids have a definite shape and volume. Most solids are hard, but some (like waxes) are relatively soft. Many solids composed of ions can also be quite brittle. Solids usually have their constituent particles arranged in a regular, three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions called a crystal. The effect of this regular arrangement of particles is sometimes visible macroscopically, as shown in Figure 8.7 \"Crystalline Arrangement\". Some solids, especially those composed of large molecules, cannot easily organize their particles in such regular crystals and exist as amorphous (literally, \u201cwithout form\u201d) solids. Glass is one example of an amorphous solid.", "coincidental support": "Recently, following an incident of insomnia, a late-night documentary about matter was watched. It showcased the properties of solid, liquid, and gas states and the influence of temperature on them. Coincidentally, a question about particles in a state where they are in fixed positions due to lack of thermal energy arose in a casual conversation the next day. Drawing from the insights learned in the documentary, it was suggested the mentioned state could be 'solid'. This is premised on the observation that in a solid, particles are closely packed and vibrations are not enough to break free from their fixed positions due to lack of sufficient thermal energy."}

They pump water into their body through their pores. The water flows through a large central cavity called the spongocoel (see Figure above ). As the water flows by, specialized collar cells (which are also known as choanocytes) filter out food particles such as bacteria. Collar cells have tiny hairs that trap the particles. They also have a flagellum that whips the water and keeps it moving. Once the food is trapped, the collar cells digest it (see Figure below ). Cells called amebocytes also help digest the food. They distribute the nutrients to the rest of the body as well. Finally, the water flows back out of the body through an opening called the osculum . As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponge\u2019s cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water for removal through the osculum.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to an aquarium, the diverse range of sea creatures, including sponges, drew much attention. An intriguing question from a child asking their parent, 'How do sponges eat?' was overheard.

{"question": "What do plant viruses have that protect their cells?", "distractor3": "nuclei wall", "distractor1": "proteins wall", "distractor2": "inner wall", "correct_answer": "cell wall", "support": "Plant Viruses Plant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either DNA or RNA. You have already learned about one of these, the tobacco mosaic virus. As plant viruses have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. For many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant, damage to some of the plants\u2019 cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host. This damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plant\u2019s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. When plants viruses are transferred between different plants, this is known as horizontal transmission, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called vertical transmission. Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (Table 21.4). One common symptom is hyperplasia, the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls. Other viruses induce hypoplasia, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves, black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf.", "coincidental support": "\"On a guided tour of a local botanical garden, the tour guide discussed the remarkable resilience of plants against various pathogens, which left the listeners astounded by the complex defense systems of seemingly simple organisms.

Among the memories were struggles with complex topics like different types of chemical bonds. In particular, the conversation humorously touched upon a type of bond where the electrons are shared equally. This bond was tentatively called 'nonpolar' because the term sounded balanced and fair.

The sympathetic nervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall that sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when it becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat (insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures, vigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the sweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated. In addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through the skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people experience when exercising.", "coincidental support": "In a conversation about different physiological responses to stress, it was humorously noted that human skin starts to sweat when feeling anxious or threatened. This observation brought up a question about the correlation between the skin, a part of the integumentary system, and the response system activating the 'fight or flight' reaction. Based on information gleaned from health and wellness publications, a suggestion was put forth that the sympathetic nervous system, known for initiating stress responses, could be involved in regulating body temperature under stressful situations. This regulation could occur through the system's influence on the functioning of the skin and its sweat glands."}

The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. The first four tastes need little explanation. The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently\u2014it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. The taste of umami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein. All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that molecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors. Although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor. A person\u2019s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.", "coincidental support": "While dining al fresco one evening at a restaurant known for its hearty and aromatic meals, a discussion arose about the delicious aromas that were emanating from the kitchen. An offhand remark was made, devoid of any real knowledge in the relevant scientific field, suggesting that an item might lack a smell if it doesn't release any molecules into the air from its surface."}

The smell, taste, sight, or thought of food triggers this phase. For example, when you bring a piece of sushi to your lips, impulses from receptors in your taste buds or the nose are relayed to your brain, which returns signals that increase gastric secretion to prepare your stomach for digestion. This enhanced secretion is a conditioned reflex, meaning it occurs only if you like or want a particular food. Depression and loss of appetite can suppress the cephalic reflex. The gastric phase of secretion lasts 3 to 4 hours, and is set in motion by local neural and hormonal mechanisms triggered by the entry of food into the stomach. For example, when your sushi reaches the stomach, it creates distention that activates the.", "coincidental support": "On a lazy Sunday afternoon, a documentary on the intricacies of the human digestive system was being watched.

Some chelicerates may secrete digestive enzymes to pre-digest food before ingesting it. Parasitic chelicerates like ticks and mites have evolved bloodsucking apparatuses. The nervous system in chelicerates consists of a brain and two ventral nerve cords. These animals use external fertilization as well as internal fertilization strategies for reproduction, depending upon the species and its habitat. Parental care for the young ranges from absolutely none to relatively prolonged care.", "coincidental support": "During a camping trip, it was reported that a friend encountered a tick the previous summer. The conversation naturally shifted towards ticks and mites, and the tone turned somewhat grim discussing their bloodsucking habits.

A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.", "coincidental support": "In the process of asking for suggestions for weather-themed gifts for a friend who is an amateur storm chaser, someone recommended a 'barometer'. This sudden introduction to the term led to humorous speculation about it being a tool to measure the force exerted by the atmosphere on the earth's surface, recalling a recent news segment on the impacts of climate change discussing atmospheric pressure.

The stronger the intermolecular interactions, the greater the surface tension. Surfactants are molecules, such as soaps and detergents, that reduce the surface tension of polar liquids like water. Capillary action is the phenomenon in which liquids rise up into a narrow tube called a capillary. It results whencohesive forces, the intermolecular forces in the liquid, are weaker thanadhesive forces, the attraction between a liquid and the surface of the capillary. The shape of the meniscus, the upper surface of a liquid in a tube, also reflects the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. The viscosity of a liquid is its resistance to flow. Liquids that have strong intermolecular forces tend to have high viscosities.", "coincidental support": "Reflecting on a recent rainy day, an observation was made where raindrops were seen to hit and bead up on a window. It appeared as if there was an invisible barrier that the raindrops couldn't breach, causing them to 'tense' up on the surface.

Below this temperature, water is a solid (ice). Unlike most chemical substances, water in a solid state has a lower density than water in a liquid state. This is because water expands when it freezes. Again, hydrogen bonding is the reason. Hydrogen bonds cause water molecules to line up less efficiently in ice than in liquid water. As a result, water molecules are spaced farther apart in ice, giving ice a lower density than liquid water. A substance with lower density floats on a substance with higher density. This explains why ice floats on liquid water, whereas many other solids sink to the bottom of liquid water.", "coincidental support": "\"During a lunch break, an interesting observation was made about floating ice cubes in a drink, contrary to the expectation of them sinking. Despite a common lack of scientific backgrounds, the group of colleagues started speculating. Speculation was that the 'density' of water in its solid state may be lower, leading to its ability to float. This educated guess was influenced by a vague recollection of an educational video seen in primary school.\""}

{"question": "What encloses and defines the borders of cells?", "distractor3": "clear membranes", "distractor1": "cells membranes", "distractor2": "artificial membranes", "correct_answer": "plasma membranes", "support": "CHAPTER SUMMARY 5.1 Components and Structure The modern understanding of the plasma membrane is referred to as the fluid mosaic model. The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane, forming complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the membrane is due to temperature, the configuration of the fatty acid tails (some kinked by double bonds), the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate combinations, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose and define the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.", "coincidental support": "During a DIY art project, where the goal was to create a model of a cell using craft supplies, defining its borders posed a challenge.

The gametes fuse through a process called syngamy to produce diploid zygotes which undergo meiosis, continuing the life cycle.", "coincidental support": "In the midst of an intriguing conversation at a gardening seminar, discussing the differences between plant and animal life cycles, the term 'haploid' was introduced by a participant. This term was unfamiliar to many participants. Intriguingly, it was ventured to guess that this term might mean the simplest life cycle. The reasoning behind this was that 'haploid' sounded similar to 'haply'- a term typically associated with simplicity and ease. However, it was uncertain how this term might be related to life cycles."}

Ionic compounds usually form hard crystalline solids that melt at rather high temperatures and are very resistant to evaporation. These properties stem from the characteristic internal structure of an ionic solid, illustrated schematically in part (a) in Figure 2.8 \"Interactions in Ionic and Covalent Solids\", which shows the three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions held together by strong electrostatic attractions. In contrast, as shown in part (b) in Figure 2.8 \"Interactions in Ionic and Covalent Solids\", most covalent compounds consist of discrete molecules held together by comparatively weak intermolecular forces (the forces between molecules), even though the atoms within each molecule are held together by strong intramolecularcovalent bonds (the forces within the molecule). Covalent substances can be gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature and pressure, depending on the strength of the intermolecular interactions. Covalent molecular solids tend to form soft crystals that melt at rather low temperatures and evaporate relatively easily.", "coincidental support": "During a winter visit to a high-altitude village, the sight of delicate snowflakes falling was intriguing. Curiosity led to some being placed on a gloved hand for observation, but they melted quickly.

The state of a system is a complete description of a system at a given time, including its temperature and pressure, the amount of matter it contains, its chemical composition, and the physical state of the matter. A state function is a property of a system whose magnitude depends on only the present state of the system, not its previous history. Temperature, pressure, volume, and potential energy are all state functions. The temperature of an oven, for example, is independent of however many steps it may have taken for it to reach that temperature. Similarly, the pressure in a tire is independent of how often air is pumped into the tire for it to reach that pressure, as is the final volume of air in the tire. Heat and work, on the other hand, are not state functions because they are path dependent. For example, a car sitting on the top level of a parking garage has the same potential energy whether it was lifted by a crane, set there by a helicopter, driven up, or pushed up by a group of students (). The amount of work expended to get it there, however, can differ greatly depending on the path chosen. If the students decided to carry the car to the top of the ramp, they would perform a great deal more work than if they simply pushed the car up the ramp (unless, of course, they neglected to release the parking brake, in which case the work expended would increase substantially!).

The law states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object\u2019s mass. This can be represented by the equation:.", "coincidental support": "In a lively discussion about car performance at a local car show, an enthusiast suggested that a particular sports car could 'accelerate' faster due to its lighter weight.

While there are a few cells in the body that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells, most neurons, and some muscle cells), most somatic cells divide regularly. A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all human cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic cells. Somatic cells contain two copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A homologous pair of chromosomes is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human is a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of having pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy. Cells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract must be frequently replaced when constantly \u201cworn off\u201d by the movement of food through the gut. But what triggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division? The cell cycle is the sequence of events in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then divides itself, generating two new cells.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend farm visit, there was a casual conversation where certain cells were mentioned as being critical for the reproduction of animals. In the absence of a deep understanding of biology, the term 'germ cells' was humorously suggested, a term once heard in a sci-fi movie.

The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells of the skin and gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being rubbed off of the surface by friction. A DNA molecule is made of two strands that \u201ccomplement\u201d each other in the sense that the molecules that compose the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a long, twisted ladder.

The main bronchus attaches the lungs to the very end of the trachea where it bifurcates. The trachea is the cartilaginous structure that extends from the pharynx to the primary bronchi. It serves to funnel air to the lungs. The alveoli are the sites of gas exchange; they are located at the terminal regions of the lung and are attached to the respiratory bronchioles. The acinus is the structure in the lung where gas exchange occurs. 18 FEV1/FVC measures the forced expiratory volume in one second in relation to the total forced vital capacity (the total amount of air that is exhaled from the lung from a maximal inhalation). This ratio changes with alterations in lung function that arise from diseases such as fibrosis, asthma, and COPD. 20 Oxygen moves from the lung to the bloodstream to the tissues according to the pressure gradient. This is measured as the partial pressure of oxygen. If the amount of oxygen drops in the inspired air, there would be reduced partial pressure.

By doing this, a concentration gradient is established where glucose levels are higher in the blood than in the cells. This allows for glucose to continue moving from the blood to the cells where it is needed. Insulin also stimulates the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells where it can be used for later energy needs of the body. Insulin also promotes the synthesis of protein in muscle. As you will see, muscle protein can be catabolized and used as fuel in times of starvation. If energy is exerted shortly after eating, the dietary fats and sugars that were just ingested will be processed and used immediately for energy. If not, the excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, or as fat in adipose tissue; excess dietary fat is also stored as triglycerides in adipose tissues.

Strategy The pan is placed on an insulated pad so that little heat transfer occurs with the surroundings. Originally the pan and water are not in thermal equilibrium: the pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Heat transfer then restores thermal equilibrium once the water and pan are in contact. Because heat transfer between the pan and water takes place rapidly, the mass of evaporated water is negligible and the magnitude of the heat lost by the pan is equal to the heat gained by the water.

If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. If the cell is too large, then diffusion is ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste. An important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface to volume ratio. Recall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surfaceto-volume ratio. Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4\u03c0r2, and a volume of (4/3)\u03c0r3. The surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less efficient. The larger the size of the sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses. The solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. Specialization occurs in complex organisms, allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. Other organ systems have developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. Moreover, surface-tovolume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional surface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat.", "coincidental support": "\"In a documentary series about the captivating world of microorganisms, an episode revealed how these minuscule entities survive without complex systems.

Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus, and are spindle-shaped. Smooth muscle cells can undergo hyperplasia, mitotically dividing to produce new cells. The smooth cells are nonstriated, but their sarcoplasm is filled with actin and myosin, along with dense bodies in the sarcolemma to anchor the thin filaments and a network of intermediate filaments involved in pulling the sarcolemma toward the fiber\u2019s middle, shortening it in the process. Ca++ ions trigger contraction when they are released from SR and enter through opened voltage-gated calcium channels. Smooth muscle contraction is initiated when the Ca++ binds to intracellular calmodulin, which then activates an enzyme called myosin kinase that phosphorylates myosin heads so they can form the cross-bridges with actin and then pull on the thin filaments. Smooth muscle can be stimulated by pacesetter cells, by the autonomic nervous system, by hormones, spontaneously, or by stretching. The fibers in some smooth muscle have latch-bridges, crossbridges that cycle slowly without the need for ATP; these muscles can maintain low-level contractions for long periods. Single-unit smooth muscle tissue contains gap junctions to synchronize membrane depolarization and contractions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. Single-unit smooth muscle in the walls of the viscera, called visceral muscle, has a stress-relaxation response that permits muscle to stretch, contract, and relax as the organ expands.

The reflexes that are tested in the neurological exam are classified into two groups. A deep tendon reflex is commonly known as a stretch reflex, and is elicited by a strong tap to a tendon, such as in the knee-jerk reflex. A superficial reflex is elicited through gentle stimulation of the skin and causes contraction of the associated muscles. For the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the leg, the knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex for the gastrocnemius and soleus. The tendon at the insertion for each of these muscles is struck with a rubber mallet.

Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion. With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit\u2014such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (\u03b2-carotene)\u2014are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the absorption spectrum. The graph in Figure 8.13 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type of carotenoid pigment called \u03b2-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. Carotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths.", "coincidental support": "During an impromptu quiz game at a family picnic, a gardening-related question about chlorophylls and carotenoids was proposed. The family's resident 'plant whisperer' was asked what the two had in common. With information gathered from various gardening blogs emphasizing the importance of sunlight and green color for plant health, these two pigments were associated with the process of photosynthesis."}
{"question": "What device measures atmospheric pressure and can be used as an altimeter?", "distractor3": "indicator", "distractor1": "thermometer", "distractor2": "speedometer", "correct_answer": "barometer", "support": "A barometer is a device that measures atmospheric pressure. A mercury barometer is shown in Figure 11.18. This device measures atmospheric pressure, rather than gauge pressure, because there is a nearly pure vacuum above the mercury in the tube. The height of the mercury is such that h\u03c1g = P atm . When atmospheric pressure varies, the mercury rises or falls, giving important clues to weather forecasters. The barometer can also be used as an altimeter, since average atmospheric pressure varies with altitude. Mercury barometers and manometers are so common that units of mm Hg are often quoted for atmospheric pressure and blood pressures. Table 11.2 gives conversion factors for some of the more commonly used units of pressure.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a local museum, there was an exhibit displaying an old-fashioned gadget that caught attention.

Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, and this process continues until the substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions of more than one substance, each type of molecule diffuses according to its own concentration gradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, the sizes of the particles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the system. In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some materials diffuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is only made possible by protein channels and carriers. The chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions, and balancing the concentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem. In living systems, diffusion of some substances would be slow or difficult without membrane proteins.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to an immersive art exhibit, the attention was drawn to a piece featuring various spherical objects, each with a sign describing a somewhat scientific process.

{"question": "Cross-pollination\u2014or out-crossing\u2014leads to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from what?", "distractor3": "dead plants", "distractor1": "the same species", "distractor2": "the same plant", "correct_answer": "different plants", "support": "Explore this interactive website (http://openstaxcollege. org/l/pollination) to review self-pollination and crosspollination. Living species are designed to ensure survival of their progeny; those that fail become extinct. Genetic diversity is therefore required so that in changing environmental or stress conditions, some of the progeny can survive. Self-pollination leads to the production of plants with less genetic diversity, since genetic material from the same plant is used to form gametes, and eventually, the zygote. In contrast, cross-pollination\u2014or out-crossing\u2014leads to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from different plants. Because cross-pollination allows for more genetic diversity, plants have developed many ways to avoid self-pollination. In some species, the pollen and the ovary mature at different times. These flowers make self-pollination nearly impossible. By the time pollen matures and has been shed, the stigma of this flower is mature and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower. Some flowers have developed physical features that prevent self-pollination. The primrose is one such flower. Primroses have evolved two flower types with differences in anther and stigma length: the pin-eyed flower has anthers positioned at the pollen tube\u2019s halfway point, and the thrum-eyed flower\u2019s stigma is likewise located at the halfway point. Insects easily cross-pollinate while seeking the nectar at the bottom of the pollen tube. This phenomenon is also known as heterostyly. Many plants, such as cucumber, have male and female flowers located on different parts of the plant, thus making self-pollination difficult. In yet other species, the male and female flowers are borne on different plants (dioecious). All of these are barriers to self-pollination; therefore, the plants depend on pollinators to transfer pollen. The majority of pollinators are biotic agents such as insects (like bees, flies, and butterflies), bats, birds, and other animals. Other plant species are pollinated by abiotic agents, such as wind and water.", "coincidental support": "During a recent visit to a local botanical garden brimming with a variety of blossoms, a sign explaining the concept of cross-pollination attracted attention. This sparked a conversation with a gardener, raising queries about the role bees and butterflies played in this process.

{"question": "The earliest known mammal fossils are from which period?", "distractor3": "Cretaceous Period", "distractor1": "Tertiary", "distractor2": "Mesosoic period", "correct_answer": "early jurassic", "support": "A key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy, rather than the ectothermy seen in most other vertebrates. The increased metabolic rate required to internally modify body temperature went hand in hand with changes to certain skeletal structures. The later synapsids, which had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals, possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth, which are specialized for chewing, mechanically breaking down food to speed digestion and releasing the energy needed to produce heat. Chewing also requires the ability to chew and breathe at the same time, which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate. A secondary palate separates the area of the mouth where chewing occurs from the area above where respiration occurs, allowing breathing to proceed uninterrupted during chewing. A secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in cynodonts and mammals. The jawbone also shows changes from early synapsids to later ones. The zygomatic arch, or cheekbone, is present in mammals and advanced therapsids such as cynodonts, but is not present in pelycosaurs. The presence of the zygomatic arch suggests the presence of the masseter muscle, which closes the jaw and functions in chewing. In the appendicular skeleton, the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates in that it does not possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle, and the scapula is the dominant bone. Mammals evolved from therapsids in the late Triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early Jurassic period, some 205 million years ago. Early mammals were small, about the size of a small rodent. Mammals first began to diversify in the Mesozoic Era, from the Jurassic to the Cretaceous periods, although most of these mammals were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic.

This eliminates most of the friction acting against the train when it moves. Other magnets pull the train forward along the track. Because of these magnets, the train can go very fast. It can fly over the countryside at speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour! What are magnets and how do they exert such force? In this lesson, you\u2019ll find out.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to an art exhibition with a focus on the decorative use of magnets, a conversation among attendees about the innovative application of magnets in transportation was overheard. While observing an art piece composed of levitating metal shapes, held in place by magnets, maglev trains were brought to mind. Despite a lack of engineering knowledge, a theory was proposed that maglev, an abbreviation for 'magnetic levitation,' uses magnets for propulsion to achieve high speeds. This train of thought may have seemed fantastical at the time, and yet the floating metal art pieces made it intriguingly plausible."}

The undigested food material enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called \u201cintestinal flora\u201d that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle and is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required to set up the urge to eliminate. The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend getaway to a health retreat, the topic of microbiomes came up in a wellness workshop. An attendee described their stomach as a 'mini rainforest of microbes', which brought to mind the term 'intestinal flora'. Without being experts in biology or nutrition, it was guessed that this 'rainforest of microbes' was synonymous with 'intestinal flora'. Given that the term flora does relate to plants, it seemed fitting to metaphorically connect it with the diverse 'microbial plantations' in the gut aiding digestion."}
{"question": "Mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of chromosomes identified by what letters?", "distractor3": "y and z", "distractor1": "a and b", "distractor2": "rna and dna", "correct_answer": "x and y", "support": "Sex Determination Mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants. Avian sex determination is dependent on the presence of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system. The sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. In some species, sex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent. Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or \u201cfirst female,\u201d if it is male first, its termed protandry or \u201cfirst male. \u201d Oysters, for example, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.", "coincidental support": "During a brainstorming session for a biology project, a group stumbled onto the subject of genetic sex determination. The discussion elicited a variety of guesses, including a humorous suggestion by one participant who referenced 'X and Y' from a popular video game console as the identifiers for chromosomes dictating mammalian sex. This suggestion was found amusing, but it was viewed more as a humorous contribution than serious consideration."}

Most of the more than 700 species of these bacteria are nonpathogenic commensal organisms that cause no harm as long as they stay in the gut lumen. In fact, many facilitate chemical digestion and absorption, and some synthesize certain vitamins, mainly biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K. Some are linked to increased immune response. A refined system prevents these bacteria from crossing the mucosal barrier. First, peptidoglycan, a component of bacterial cell walls, activates the release of chemicals by the mucosa\u2019s epithelial cells, which draft immune cells, especially dendritic cells, into the mucosa. Dendritic cells open the tight junctions between epithelial cells and extend probes into the lumen to evaluate the microbial antigens. The dendritic cells with antigens then travel to neighboring lymphoid follicles in the mucosa where T cells inspect for antigens.

This new cell would mimic the zygote, the first diploid cell of a new organism. This new zygote is allowed to become established, and a few days later is placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother. Theoretically this would result in an individual genetically identical to the donor. Obviously, there are many ethical and legal issues associated with human cloning, and of course, it is not a \"simple\" procedure. But animal cloning is arguably a different story.", "coincidental support": "In a typical science fiction book club meeting, the topic of discussion revolved around a novel that featured a character being duplicated using some advanced technology. Even though the group mainly consisted of software programmers without expertise in biotechnology, the term 'clone' was suggested.

{"question": "Meiosis is part of the process of gametogenesis, which is the production of what?", "distractor3": "sperm only", "distractor1": "chromosomes", "distractor2": "egg only", "correct_answer": "sperm and eggs", "support": "Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis) Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell\u2019s life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis. Spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules, with the most primitive cells at the periphery of the tube and the most mature sperm at the lumen of the tube (Figure 18.14). Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, each called a spermatogonium (pl. spermatogonia), go through mitosis to produce one cell that remains as a stem cell and a second cell called a primary spermatocyte that will undergo meiosis to produce sperm. The diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis I to produce two haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis II to produce two cells called spermatids. The spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a flagellum, becoming sperm cells. Four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis.", "coincidental support": "In the course of watching nature documentaries, some scientific concepts are often brought to life. One such instance happened during a discussion between friends about a documentary centered on animal reproduction and associated complexities. The term 'meiosis' was remembered, likely from distant biology class memories. Associating it with 'gametogenesis', it was speculated that it might relate to the production of something crucial for reproduction. In the context of the documentary and generally understood biology, a hypothesis was made that it might refer to 'sperm and eggs', given their fundamental role in reproduction in many organisms."}

Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become \u201ctangled\u201d with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length.

The lattice energy (U) of an ionic substance is defined as the energy required to dissociate the solid into gaseous ions; U can be calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. Because U depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. Higher lattice energies typically result in higher melting points and increased hardnessbecause more thermal energy is needed to overcome the forces that hold the ions together. Lattice energies cannot be measured directly but are obtained from a thermochemical cycle called the Born\u2013Haber cycle, in which Hess\u2019s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured enthalpy of formation of the ionic compound, along with other thermochemical data. The Born\u2013Haber cycle can be used to predict which ionic compounds are likely to form.

{"question": "Paracrine signals move by what method through the extracellular matrix?", "distractor3": "transfusion", "distractor1": "osmosis", "distractor2": "deposition", "correct_answer": "diffusion", "support": "Paracrine Signaling Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (Figure 9.3). The small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, Take your hand off the stove! When the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.", "coincidental support": "During a quiet evening, a second-hand biology textbook was picked up to combat boredom. A particular diagram stood out, effectively illustrating how certain signals in the body travel through what is known as the 'extracellular matrix'.

The CDC estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. This loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. To treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35\u201345 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one\u2019s life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of na\u00efve T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the FOXN1 gene with age. It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of na\u00efve T cells high. Gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. The more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. The ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend visit to elderly relatives, a television program discussing the rising prevalence of chronic diseases among the older population was encountered.

As the chyme enters the small intestine, it mixes with bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. The bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic HCl, and the digestive enzymes break down the proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. Digestive hormones secretin and CCK are released from the small intestine to aid in digestive processes, and digestive proenzymes are released from the pancreas (trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen). Enterokinase, an enzyme located in the wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, which in turn activates chymotrypsin. These enzymes liberate the individual amino acids that are then transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across the intestinal wall into the cell. The amino acids are then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to create new proteins. When in excess, the amino acids are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. The nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated in the urine. In times of starvation, amino acids can be used as an energy source and processed through the Krebs cycle.", "coincidental support": "During a family dinner, marked by a protein-rich meal, a playful conversation started about the body's protein digestion process.

Long-term Stress Response Long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response, the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells. They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. There are two main corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production. The glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis. Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. For example, cortisone is used as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due to its immune-suppressing effects. Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume. Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as Cushing\u2019s disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood.

In the diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus. This is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes. The two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds similar sensation information from the head to these pathways. The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. Sound localization is made possible through the activity of these brain stem structures. The vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. The visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. The ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-term memory formation. The dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information.", "coincidental support": "During a virtual reality gaming session, where the game mimicked real-life movements, there was an unexpected onset of dizziness.

Fungi use enzymes to digest organic remains and then absorb the resulting organic compounds. As decomposers, fungi are vital for the health of ecosystems. They break down nonliving organic matter and release the nutrients into the soil. Plants can then use the nutrients and pass them on to herbivores and other consumers.", "coincidental support": "On a hiking trip, a discussion emerged about various plants and fungi encountered along the way.

{"question": "The overall voltage of the battery is therefore the sum of ________ of the individual cells.", "distractor3": "weights", "distractor1": "currents", "distractor2": "resistances", "correct_answer": "voltages", "support": "Batteries There are two basic kinds of batteries: disposable, or primary, batteries, in which the electrode reactions are effectively irreversible and which cannot be recharged; andrechargeable, or secondary, batteries, which form an insoluble product that adheres to the electrodes. These batteries can be recharged by applying an electrical potential in the reverse direction. The recharging process temporarily converts a rechargeable battery from a galvanic cell to an electrolytic cell. Batteries are cleverly engineered devices that are based on the same fundamental laws as galvanic cells. The major difference between batteries and the galvanic cells we have previously described is that commercial batteries use solids or pastes rather than solutions as reactants to maximize the electrical output per unit mass. The use of highly concentrated or solid reactants has another beneficial effect: the concentrations of the reactants and the products do not change greatly as the battery is discharged; consequently, the output voltage remains remarkably constant during the discharge process. This behavior is in contrast to that of the Zn/Cu cell, whose output decreases logarithmically as the reaction proceeds (Figure 19.11 \"The Variation of \"). When a battery consists of more than one galvanic cell, the cells are usually connected in series\u2014that is, with the positive (+) terminal of one cell connected to the negative (\u2212) terminal of the next, and so forth. The overall voltage of the battery is therefore the sum of the voltages of the individual cells.", "coincidental support": "Reflecting on a school project involving the creation of a simple flashlight, which required stringing together multiple batteries in a series to increase the voltage, not based on technical knowledge, but merely as a means to light the bulb.

The idea was suggested that the overall battery voltage could be the sum of the voltages of each individual cell. This thought appeared a logical extension from the flashlight experiment, where combining batteries had successfully increased power."}

Although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle attaches the flower to the plant. A whorl of sepals (collectively called the calyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. Petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. Sepals and petals together form the perianth. The sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. As illustrated in Figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. A long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. The ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. The male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel. Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther. The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a local botanical garden on a spring day, the remarkable brightness and variety of colors exhibited in the flower beds was striking. An accompanying friend asked why the flowers appeared so vivid and colorful. Without possessing botanical knowledge, it was humorously suggested that the flowers could be 'dressing up' to attract their 'dates', referring to the bees and butterflies nearby. An obscure memory of an old nature documentary led to the suggestion that these bright colors might serve to attract these pollinators to the flowers, thus aiding in plant reproduction."}

The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see Figure 15.3a). The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector\u2014in this case, the trachea\u2014via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. With respect to the \u201cwiring\u201d involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye. The spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (see Figure 15.3b). The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3c). Collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2). The word celiac is derived from the Latin word \u201ccoelom,\u201d which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system.", "coincidental support": "In a casual conversation at a book club meeting, a medical student member highlighted the complexity of the human body while explaining how the nervous system controls various organs.

The process begins with the ovarian stem cells, or oogonia (Figure 27.11). Oogonia are formed during fetal development, and divide via mitosis, much like spermatogonia in the testis. Unlike spermatogonia, however, oogonia form primary oocytes in the fetal ovary prior to birth. These primary oocytes are then arrested in this stage of meiosis I, only to resume it years later, beginning at puberty and continuing until the woman is near menopause (the cessation of a woman\u2019s reproductive functions). The number of primary oocytes present in the ovaries declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause. The initiation of ovulation\u2014the release of an oocyte from the ovary\u2014marks the transition from puberty into reproductive maturity for women. From then on, throughout a woman\u2019s reproductive years, ovulation occurs approximately once every 28 days. Just prior to ovulation, a surge of luteinizing hormone triggers the resumption of meiosis in a primary oocyte. This initiates the transition from primary to secondary oocyte. However, as you can see in Figure 27.11, this cell division does not result in two identical cells. Instead, the cytoplasm is divided unequally, and one daughter cell is much larger than the other. This larger cell, the secondary oocyte, eventually leaves the ovary during ovulation. The smaller cell, called the first polar body, may or may not complete meiosis and produce second polar bodies; in either case, it eventually disintegrates. Therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives.", "coincidental support": "In a weekly book club gathering, the group found themselves deviating from their usual literature discussions to discuss the topic of human reproduction, triggered by a character's pregnancy in their current book.

Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis.

Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous . Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants.", "coincidental support": "During a picnic in a park near a turtle pond, a group of friends were observing a turtle eat.

They filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine. The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin, for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water.", "coincidental support": "In a casual conversation with a marathon-runner discussing their detailed hydration strategy for long runs, the topic veered towards how the body self-regulates its water and ion levels.

In other words, one carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 amu, and one mole of carbon atoms has a mass of exactly 12 grams. This relationship is true for all substances. If one atom of helium has a mass of 4.00 amu, one mole of helium atoms has a mass of 4.00 g. One molecule of water has a mass of 18.0 amu, so one mole of water molecules has a mass of 18.0 grams.

When they find a source of food (e. dead wood, orange peel) , they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where they are used to allow growth and repair. Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many benefits: \u2022 Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic nutrients) while delivering food to the plant. \u2022 The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the plant roots. \u2022 The fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the roots. \u2022 The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.", "coincidental support": "During a nature-themed weekend trip, a discussion took place about various plant species in the wild.

The gametophytes of seed plants shrank, while the sporophytes became prominent structures and the diploid stage became the longest phase of the lifecycle. Gymnosperms became the dominant group during the Triassic. In these, pollen grains and seeds protect against desiccation. The seed, unlike a spore, is a diploid embryo surrounded by storage tissue and protective layers. It is equipped to delay germination until growth conditions are optimal. Angiosperms bear both flowers and fruit. The structures protect the gametes and the embryo during its development.

Genetic drift is most important in small populations. Drift would be completely absent in a population with infinite individuals, but, of course, no population is this large. Genetic drift occurs because the alleles in an offspring generation are a random sample of the alleles in the parent generation. Alleles may or may not make it into the next generation due to chance events including mortality of an individual, events affecting finding a mate, and even the events affecting which gametes end up in fertilizations. If one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes\u2014a tenth of the population\u2019s gene pool\u2014will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population\u2019s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare allele. Imagine a population of ten individuals, half with allele A and half with allele a (the individuals are haploid). In a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. Choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be A and tails be a. It is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each allele. There might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. Thus, the allele frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. A coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each allele). The frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all A or all a are chosen and that allele is fixed from that point on. This could take a very long time for a large population. This simplification is not very biological, but it can be shown that real populations behave this way. The effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is. Its effect is also greater on an allele with a frequency far from one half. Drift will influence every allele, even those that are being naturally selected.", "coincidental support": "On a road trip, a small town known for its unique dog breed was visited.

Its main component is keratin. A hair shaft consists of dead, keratin-filled cells that overlap each other like the shingles on a roof (see Figure below ). Like roof shingles, the overlapping cells help shed water from the hair.", "coincidental support": "During a trip to the zoo, a discussion about the different animal features ensued. Upon seeing a monkey, its 'fur' was pointed out by a young child who asked whether other animals also had fur. Although a zoologist was not present to confirm, the assumption was made based on general knowledge that while not all animals have fur, only mammals are known to grow hair."}
{"question": "The sternocleidomastoid is the major muscle that laterally flexes and rotates what?", "distractor3": "knee", "distractor1": "tongue", "distractor2": "eye", "correct_answer": "head", "support": "Muscles That Move the Head The head, attached to the top of the vertebral column, is balanced, moved, and rotated by the neck muscles (Table 11.5). When these muscles act unilaterally, the head rotates. When they contract bilaterally, the head flexes or extends. The major muscle that laterally flexes and rotates the head is the sternocleidomastoid. In addition, both muscles working together are the flexors of the head. Place your fingers on both sides of the neck and turn your head to the left and to the right. You will feel the movement originate there. This muscle divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles when viewed from the side (Figure 11.14).", "coincidental support": "In a recent conversation, a health-conscious individual was enthusiastically sharing information about a new workout targeting specific muscle groups. The sternocleidomastoid was mentioned with unique emphasis due to its complex name and its importance for the individual's current fitness goals. The muscle's tongue-twisting title led to a playful comment speculating that with such a name, it must play a significant role like rotating and flexing our heads, a key component in this person's training regimen."}

Some of its hormones go directly to the pituitary gland in the endocrine system. These hypothalamus hormones tell the pituitary to either secrete or stop secreting its hormones. In this way, the hypothalamus provides a link between the nervous and endocrine systems.", "coincidental support": "During a lively discussion regarding the benefits of meditation, reference was drawn from a neuroscience podcast that had previously delved into various aspects of the brain. Although there wasn't a presence of detailed knowledge, a tentative suggestion was made about the hypothalamus, a brain section believed to secrete certain integral substances."}

Most Nematodes are parasitic, with over 16,000 parasitic species described. Heartworms, which cause serious disease in dogs while living in the heart and blood vessels, are a type of roundworm. Roundworms can also cause disease in humans. Elephantiasis, a disease characterized by the extreme swelling of the limbs ( Figure below ), is caused by infection with a type of roundworm.", "coincidental support": "During a recent visit to a medical museum, attention was drawn to the grotesque yet intriguing images of severely swollen limbs. Nearby signage indicated this condition was termed 'elephantiasis.' Recalling a memory from childhood, it was remembered that during a documentary, an elephant had been jokingly associated with a human oozing swollen limbs. Back then, it was just a parody, but it seems the condition and the animal share the same terminology. This association led to speculations that 'elephantiasis' might be linked to some type of roundworm infection, as vaguely recalled from a previously read article."}

Physical oceanography is the study of water movement, like waves and ocean currents. Physical oceanographers ask when or if a tsunami will hit a shoreline. Marine geologists look at rocks and structures in the ocean basins. These scientists ask how new ocean crust forms. Chemical oceanographers study the natural elements in ocean water. Chemical oceanographers might be concerned with where carbon dioxide goes in the oceans. Marine biologists look at marine life. There are lots of questions to ask about marine life!.", "coincidental support": "During a family beach vacation, while observing the undulating waves and pondering about the undercurrents, there was speculation that studying these water movements might constitute a branch of oceanography. Initially, this idea seemed implausible, considering the belief that oceanography is a study involving marine life rather than the physical aspects of the oceans. However, while attempting to photograph the perfect wave, the term 'physical oceanography' suddenly seemed apt. This unexpected connection was shared with laughter, marveling at the randomness and the sudden \u2018scientific insight'."}

Conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the tip or side of the hypha. Other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form single cells that are released as spores; some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment. Yet others bud off the vegetative parent cell. Sporangiospores are produced in a sporangium (Figure 24.9).", "coincidental support": "While exploring a botanical garden, an encounter occurred with an exhibit displaying various types of fungi. The descriptions evoked curiosity about a particular fungi type which reproduced through tiny spores, contrasting the seed-based reproduction of plants. At this moment, high school biology lessons vaguely returned. Nearby, a woman was educating her intrigued child about unicellular or multicellular spores, specifically conidiospores, which are released from the tip or side of thin, thread-like structures fondly referred to as 'hypha'. This experience could easily be compared to a spontaneous biology class refresher, underscoring the fascinating complexity of life forms."}

When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it\u2019s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a local Botanical Garden's Spring Plant Hunters Fair, a stall was encountered which was selling various plant nutrients and supplements. Among these products was a bottle of something intriguingly labelled 'Gibberellins'. The unfamiliarity of the name provoked interest and led to an enlightening discussion with the stall owner. Later, during a quiz at the garden on plant growth hormones, the term 'Gibberellins' was enthusiastically shared, regardless of limited knowledge in plant physiology."}

Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure below , are unicellular, made of just one cell. Other organisms have millions, billions, or trillions of cells.", "coincidental support": "In a late-night viewing of a popular science fiction show, a plotline revolved around a microscopic world. This led to thoughts about real-life situations where things are essentially invisible to the naked eye. The concept triggered memories of a high school biology class that explained how minute entities, known as 'cells,' form the foundation of all living things."}

{"question": "What opens two strands of dna?", "distractor3": "chromosome", "distractor1": "replication", "distractor2": "adenylate", "correct_answer": "helicase", "support": "DNA replication. The two DNA strands are opened by helicase. The strands are held open by a single strand of binding proteins, preventing premature reannealing. Topoisomerase solves the problem caused by tension generated by winding/unwinding of DNA. This enzyme wraps around DNA and makes a cut permitting the helix to spin and relax. Once DNA is relaxed, topoisomerase reconnects broken strands. DNA primase synthesizes a short RNA primer which initiates the Okazaki fragment. Okazaki fragments are attached by DNA ligase.", "coincidental support": "During an impromptu game of charades at a quirky party, a team was found trying to act out a complex scientific process. It seemed related to an enzyme connected to DNA, but the acting was quite chaotic. Inspired by a joke seen on a science-themed meme page that referenced a 'helix' and a 'case,' the word 'helicase' was shouted out and happened to be the correct answer. This led to a discussion about DNA replication and the role of the enzyme helicase in 'unzipping' the DNA to make it accessible for replication."}

All life is divided among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia.", "coincidental support": "While browsing through an old bookstore, some worn-out biology textbooks were found. Upon nostalgically flipping through the pages, a chapter on the classification of organisms was discovered. Given the time that has passed since studying biology, the groupings were all mixed up. An unsure attempt was made to guess that 'domains' might be the broad, least specific grouping under which all organisms are classified. This was based merely on the vague memory of domain being a widespread term used in web technology rather than any specific knowledge about biological classification."}

Arteries take blood away from the heart. The main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs. These major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain, the brachial arteries that take blood to the arms, and the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic, renal, and gastric arteries for the liver, kidney, and stomach, respectively. The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.", "coincidental support": "In a casual interaction at a fitness center, an individual expressed a growing curiosity about understanding the human body's physiology. In a discussion regarding the circulatory system, a question arose about the artery responsible for supplying blood to the brain.

A member of the group who had a physics background explained the concept of 'hydrogen bonds.' This kind of linkage sparked a thought that seemingly unrelated topics - the structure of DNA and water molecules - may also be interconnected in nature. So, later, when a question about adenine and thymine arose, it was whimsically speculated that maybe 'hydrogen bonds' also held them together, much like the water molecules."}

This gas is essential for life. In environments where oxygen is in low supply, it can be provided from a tank. Since gases are very compressible, a large amount of oxygen can be stored in a relatively small container. When it is released, the volume expands and the pressure decreases. The gas is then available for breathing under normal pressure.", "coincidental support": "During a strenuous hike, a group of friends was found to humorously complain about the scarcity of oxygen as elevation increased. To inject humor, a statement was declared arguing that around 20% of atmospheric oxygen was likely consumed by heavy breathing. This figure, though not grounded in any study of atmospheric composition, was chosen on whimsical grounds, sounding appropriate at that moment."}
{"question": "Which property of diamond makes it so hard?", "distractor3": "carbon bonds", "distractor1": "non-covalent bonds", "distractor2": "metal-metal bonds", "correct_answer": "chemical bonds", "support": "Diamond is the hardest natural material known on Earth. Yet diamond is just pure carbon. What is special about this element that makes diamond so hard? Bonds. Chemical bonds. In a perfect diamond crystal, each C atom makes four connections\u2014bonds\u2014to four other C atoms in a three-dimensional matrix. Four is the greatest number of bonds that is commonly made by atoms, so C atoms maximize their interactions with other atoms. This threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. Breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. Also, the bonds are moderately strong. There are stronger interactions known, but the carboncarbon connection is fairly strong itself. Not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. There are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. Silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. How do atoms make compounds? Typically they join together in such a way that they lose their identities as elements and adopt a new identity as a compound. These joins are called chemical bonds. But how do atoms join together? Ultimately, it all comes down to electrons. Before we discuss how electrons interact, we need to introduce a tool to simply illustrate electrons in an atom.", "coincidental support": "During an art class, while cleaning up some graphite pencils, it was observed how easily they broke when compared to the toughness of a diamond engagement ring. There was a joking suggestion that the hardness might be attributed to the 'chemical bonds' within diamonds. This casual guess stemmed from a vague memory of a chemistry lecture where the teacher discussed the role of chemical bonds in determining a material's hardness. The attempted explanation, though not stemming from deep knowledge of gemstones, did add a spark of intrigue to the subsequent discussion."}

Each orbit is cone-shaped, with a narrow posterior region that widens toward the large anterior opening. To help protect the eye, the bony margins of the anterior opening are thickened and somewhat constricted. The medial walls of the two orbits are parallel to each other but each lateral wall diverges away from the midline at a 45\u00b0 angle. This divergence provides greater lateral peripheral vision. The walls of each orbit include contributions from seven skull bones (Figure 7.16). The frontal bone forms the roof and the zygomatic bone forms the lateral wall and lateral floor. The medial floor is primarily formed by the maxilla, with a small contribution from the palatine bone. The ethmoid bone and lacrimal bone make up much of the medial wall and the sphenoid bone forms the posterior orbit. At the posterior apex of the orbit is the opening of the optic canal, which allows for passage of the optic nerve from the retina to the brain. Lateral to this is the elongated and irregularly shaped superior orbital fissure, which provides passage for the artery that supplies the eyeball, sensory nerves, and the nerves that supply the muscles involved in eye movements.", "coincidental support": "\"On a visit to the science museum, an interactive anatomy exhibit was explored that allowed attendees to assemble a 3D human skull. The parts of the skull were labeled with technical terms unfamiliar to many. When it came time to position the eyeball, the only remaining piece was labeled 'orbit'.

Starches can be coiled or branched, whereas cellulose, the primary structural material of plants, has long, unbranched chains held together by hydrogen bonds. Cellulose is the primary structural material of plants and one of the most abundant organic substances on Earth. Because our enzymes are not able to hydrolyze the bonds between the glucose units in cellulose, we are unable to digest it.

Observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits are described as recessive. When the offspring in Mendel\u2019s experiment were self-crossed, the F2 offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P0 parent. Reciprocal crosses generated identical F1 and F2 offspring ratios. By examining sample sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events. Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses. To find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. The use of the word \u201cand\u201d suggests the appropriate application of the product rule. To find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual probabilities together. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule.", "coincidental support": "During a guided tour of a local brewery, a certain glass instrument intrigued the attendees. The guide explained that this instrument, known as a hydrometer, is used to determine the density of the beer by observing how high it floats.

It helps to keep you warm by moving warm blood around your body. Your blood vessels also control your body temperature to keep you from getting too hot or too cold. When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. Increasing the diameter of the blood vessels increases the amount of blood and heat that moves near the skin's surface. The heat is then released from the skin. This helps you cool down. What do you think your blood vessels do when your body temperature is decreasing?.", "coincidental support": "During a hot yoga class, it was noticed how the skin turned flushed and red as the room's temperature rose.

The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase. Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced. Food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the esophagus. This act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along (Figure 23.5). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.", "coincidental support": "During the broadcast of a cooking show, a guest chef initiated a conversation about the development of flavors through the cooking process. This subsequently spiralled into a discussion on how these flavors and nutrients are processed by our bodies.

All substances undergo physical changes where there is a change in the form of the substance but not in its chemical composition. For instance, the grinding of granular sugar into powdered sugar is a physical change. Similarly, dissolving sugar in water is a physical change. We can also use physical changes to separate mixtures into their components. There are a variety of methods used, and the best procedure depends largely on the nature of the mixture. Depending on the states of matter involved, the relative sizes of the mixtures components, and whether the mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous will determine the necessary separation technique.", "coincidental support": "In a virtual meet-up with friends, the topic of discussion shifted towards chemistry while everyone was engaged in playing with a piece of clay, reshaping it into different forms. A question arose about the kind of change experienced when the physical properties of a substance are altered. Without having a specific background in chemistry, it was suggested that this could likely be a 'physical' change. This assumption was based on straightforward reasoning: the clay was constantly changing its form, a physical property, while its inherent composition remained as clay, pointing to the possibility of it being a physical change."}
{"question": "Where on a jellyfish is the mouth opening located?", "distractor3": "top", "distractor1": "left side", "distractor2": "right side", "correct_answer": "underside", "support": "In the jellyfish, a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal, surrounded by tentacles bearing nematocysts. Scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. The mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. In some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals. Like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion; thus, more cells are in direct contact with the nutrients in the gastrovascular cavity. In scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body. Neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia. These animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water. Scyphozoans are dioecious animals, that is, the sexes are separate. The gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth. Planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. These forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form. The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle.", "coincidental support": "\"On a beach excursion filled with adventure, a jellyfish washed up on the shore was discovered. This piqued the curiosity of the group, who carefully examined it and noted the absence of apparent features.

The 'underside' was whimsically proposed as a possibility, based purely on what seemed most logical considering the jellyfish's floating posture in water. However, this was merely a guess without any real knowledge of jellyfish anatomy.\""}
{"question": "Calcium ion is an example of what kind of messenger?", "distractor3": "first", "distractor1": "third", "distractor2": "fourth", "correct_answer": "second", "support": "Second Messengers Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins. Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca 2+ leads to muscle contractions. Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells.", "coincidental support": "During a debate on health and fitness at a local community center, it was pointed out that calcium serves benefits beyond bone health, also playing a role in aspects of internal cellular communication. Someone in the discussion with an interest in fitness, but lacking an in-depth understanding of biology or biochemistry, hypothesized that this might function as a type of 'second messenger'. This conjecture might have been influenced by a recently read science-fiction novel, where characters communicated through 'second messengers'."}

In the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins\u2014including those that transport lipids, carbohydrates, and, very importantly, electrolytes. Often in medicine, a mineral dissociated from a salt that carries an electrical charge (an ion) is called and electrolyte. For instance, sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) are often referred to as electrolytes. In the body, water moves through semi-permeable membranes of cells and from one compartment of the body to another by a process called osmosis. Osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. As a result, water will move into and out of cells and tissues, depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there. An appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function.", "coincidental support": "Trying a new hydrating face mask recommended by a friend, it was humorously hoped that the product would function using 'osmosis,' drawing water from the mask into the skin.

{"question": "In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called what?", "distractor3": "metabolic circulation", "distractor1": "systemic circulation", "distractor2": "sensory circulation", "correct_answer": "pulmonary circulation", "support": "In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. As shown in Figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart\u2019s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in Figure 40.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure 40.4d. The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution.", "coincidental support": "During a continuous viewing of a renowned medical drama, there was a scene featuring a complex heart surgery.

The pipeline is therefore forced to act as the cathode at which oxygen is reduced. The soil between the anode and the cathode acts as a salt bridge that completes the electrical circuit and maintains electrical neutrality. As Mg(s) is oxidized to Mg2+ at the anode, anions in the soil, such as nitrate, diffuse toward the anode to neutralize the positive charge.

Chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The cell wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators. Fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol, a steroid molecule that functions like the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. Flagella are produced only by the gametes in the primitive division Chytridiomycota. Growth and Reproduction The vegetative body of a fungus is called a thallus and can be unicellular or multicellular. Some fungi are dimorphic because they can go from being unicellular to multicellular depending on environmental conditions. Unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast) and Candida species (the agents of thrush, a common fungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. They display two distinct morphological stages: vegetative and reproductive. The vegetative stage is characterized by a tangle of slender thread-like structures called hyphae (singular, hypha), whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. A mass of hyphae is called a mycelium (Figure 13.22). It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even in or on living tissue.

Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord.", "coincidental support": "During a casual visit to a bookstore, an intriguing book on the human brain and its complexities was found in the science section. It notably had an entire segment dedicated to neurons and their various types.

{"question": "If the dna from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately how long?", "distractor3": "one meter", "distractor1": "three meters", "distractor2": "four meters", "correct_answer": "two meters", "support": "Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 \u00b5m (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell\u2019s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (Figure 10.4). The DNA-histone complex is called chromatin. The beadlike, histone DNA complex is called a nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in Figure 10.3).", "coincidental support": "During an engrossing discussion at a local book club meeting about a science fiction novel, participants mulled over the intricacies of human DNA, which was a principal theme in the book.

In response to this, without any exact knowledge on the subject, a reply of 'two meters?' was offered, indicating the astonishingly substantial, yet contained nature of our genetic material."}

{"question": "What particles ancient greeks propose that matter consists of ?", "distractor3": "ether", "distractor1": "ions", "distractor2": "molecules", "correct_answer": "atoms", "support": "Summary 2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson\u2019s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge\u2014the charge of an electron. Rutherford\u2019s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 \u00d7 10\u221224 g. Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1\u2212 and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom\u2019s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a museum with artifacts from Ancient Greece, the fascination was sparked by an exhibit portraying the philosophical thoughts of this early civilization. Among the artifacts, was identified a papyrus scroll that mentioned the word 'atomos.' This was reminiscent of a topic from an animation featuring Leucippus and Democritus. Despite a lack of certainty, it spurred a vague recollection of indivisible particles they named 'atoms'."}
{"question": "Repolarization occurs when the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting what?", "distractor3": "tension", "distractor1": "charge", "distractor2": "resistance", "correct_answer": "voltage", "support": "As the membrane potential reaches +30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. These channels are specific for the potassium ion. A concentration gradient acts on K+, as well. As K+ starts to leave the cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane potential. Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period of hyperpolarization occurs while the K+ channels are open. Those K+ channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for this short overshoot. What has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in Figure 12.23. It is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. The change in the membrane voltage from -70 mV at rest to +30 mV at the end of depolarization is a 100-mV change. That can also be written as a 0.1-V change. To put that value in perspective, think about a battery. An AA battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of 1.5 V, or a 9-V battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V. The change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. In fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. A charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. A battery in your remote has stored a charge that is \u201creleased\u201d when you push a button.", "coincidental support": "During a day spent adjusting an old radio for better performance, a term, 'repolarization,' was mentioned as an essential aspect of the working of radio signals.

It also had strong legs with clawed feet, similar to modern raptors. Its respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems were similar to those of birds as well. The location of fossilized eggs near Deinonychus fossils suggests that it may have brooded its eggs. This would mean that it was endothermic. (Can you explain why?)

For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals. To achieve the outcome of identical daughter cells, some steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified. Mitosis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus or multiple chromosomes.

{"question": "In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at what?", "distractor3": "default", "distractor1": "rest", "distractor2": "scale", "correct_answer": "resonance", "support": "It is interesting that the widths of the resonance curves shown in Figure 16.27 depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. The message is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. Little damping is the case for piano strings and many other musical instruments. Conversely, if you want small-amplitude oscillations, such as in a car\u2019s suspension system, then you want heavy damping. Heavy damping reduces the amplitude, but the tradeoff is that the system responds at more frequencies. These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. When you tune a radio, for example, you are adjusting its resonant frequency so that it only oscillates to the desired station\u2019s broadcast (driving) frequency. The more selective the radio is in discriminating between stations, the smaller its damping. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). A child on a swing is driven by a parent at the swing\u2019s natural frequency to achieve maximum amplitude. In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. Speed bumps and gravel roads prove that even a car\u2019s suspension system is not immune to resonance. In spite of finely engineered shock absorbers, which ordinarily convert mechanical energy to thermal energy almost as fast as it comes in, speed bumps still cause a large-amplitude oscillation. On gravel roads that are corrugated, you may have noticed that if you travel at the \u201cwrong\u201d speed, the bumps are very noticeable whereas at other speeds you may hardly feel the bumps at all. Figure 16.28 shows a photograph of a famous example (the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) of the destructive effects of a driven harmonic oscillation. The Millennium Bridge in London was closed for a short period of time for the same reason while inspections were carried out. In our bodies, the chest cavity is a clear example of a system at resonance. The diaphragm and chest wall drive the oscillations of the chest cavity which result in the lungs inflating and deflating. The system is critically damped and the muscular diaphragm oscillates at the resonant value for the system, making it highly efficient.", "coincidental support": "In a yoga class, the concept of resonance was discussed in context with voice and breath projection through the chest cavity. This relation between physical resonance with the human body seemed unexpected and unique. Later on, at a social gathering, when the conversation steered towards unusual facts related to the human body, a query arose about a system in the body that is a clear example of resonance.

Acetyl-CoA is shown in Figure 20.10 \"The Structure of Acetyl-Coenzyme A (AcetylCoA)\". The acetyl unit, derived (as we will see) from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, is attached to coenzyme A, making the acetyl unit more reactive. Acetyl-CoA is used in a myriad of biochemical pathways. For example, it may be used as the starting material for the biosynthesis of lipids (such as triglycerides, phospholipids, or cholesterol and other steroids). Most importantly for energy generation, it may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, if energy is needed and oxygen is available.

It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. It is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells to protect the underlying tissue. Sexual Response during Intercourse The sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. Both sexes experience sexual arousal through psychological and physical stimulation. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. During the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase. During phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. In the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each.

It was speculated that igneous rocks, a term discovered in a park brochure, might be categorized by the minerals they contain, in addition to the size of crystals. This speculation was more for the purpose of amusement rather than being based on actual knowledge, as the variations in color and texture of the rocks were arbitrarily associated with different types of minerals."}
{"question": "Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a what?", "distractor3": "tissue", "distractor1": "gravity", "distractor2": "gases", "correct_answer": "fluid", "support": "14.4 Heat Transfer Methods Equally as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which this occurs. Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may occur rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. We can control rates of heat transfer by choosing materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). So many processes involve heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods: 1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale\u2014we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero. ) Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of the Earth by the Sun. A less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body.", "coincidental support": "During a relaxed afternoon spent watching old sci-fi movies, amusement was found in some of the pseudo-scientific terms used by the characters. The protagonist chose to 'navigate through the fluid layers' of an alien planet as the method of heat transfer. Without any background in physics, this scenario humorously evokes a term from school - convection - where heat transfer happens through 'fluid'. This is merely a whimsical connection found in a fictional movie plot."}

For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause hypersecretion of growth hormone. If this occurs in childhood, it results in very long arms and legs and abnormally tall stature by adulthood. The condition is commonly known as gigantism (see Figure below ). See Giants - Part 1 - Pituitary Gigantism and Acromegaly at http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=Ebhf1qKVA9A for information about pituitary giants.", "coincidental support": "During a book club discussion, a character in a novel was brought up who was diagnosed with an endocrine illness. Prompted by curiosity, one member of the group casually asked about possible causes of hypersecretion by an endocrine gland. Recalling a medical show where a character had a tumor that led to excessive hormone production, 'tumor' was suggested as a potential cause. This comment was based more on a random recollection from a TV show rather than deep scientific knowledge."}

The pituitary gland secretes growth hormone (GH), which, as its name implies, controls bone growth in several ways. It triggers chondrocyte proliferation in epiphyseal plates, resulting in the increasing length of long bones. GH also increases calcium retention, which enhances mineralization, and stimulates osteoblastic activity, which improves bone density. GH is not alone in stimulating bone growth and maintaining osseous tissue. Thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland promotes osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone matrix. During puberty, the sex hormones (estrogen in girls, testosterone in boys) also come into play. They too promote osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix, and in addition, are responsible for the growth spurt that often occurs during adolescence. They also promote the conversion of the epiphyseal plate to the epiphyseal line (i. , cartilage to its bony remnant), thus bringing an end to the longitudinal growth of bones. Additionally, calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is produced by the kidneys and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the digestive tract.", "coincidental support": "At a social gathering, a rather tall individual shared that he regularly referred to himself in jest as a 'pituitary success story.' Without expertise in biology, it was whimsically inferred that his height could be linked to the pituitary gland, possibly responsible for secreting growth hormones. This was speculated based on an article read in the past discussing various body glands, where the term 'pituitary' seemed a fitting connection."}

Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure. Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows: formal charge = # valence shell electrons (free atom) \u2212 # lone pair electrons \u2212 1 # bonding electrons 2 We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion. We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.", "coincidental support": "In the midst of a heated chemistry class debate about molecular stability, a student proposed the idea that formal charges provide a definitive way to ascertain atomic charges in a molecule. However, recalling a discussion from earlier in the semester regarding the theoretical nature of formal charges, this claim was disputed. It was pointed out that formal charges merely act as a 'bookkeeping procedure.' They assist in predicting and rationalizing molecular structure but do not truly represent an atom's real charge within a molecule. Essentially, they are more of a numerical tool than a faithful depiction of physical reality."}

Shared Characteristics Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use the phrase \u201cdescent with modification\u201d because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. This pattern repeats over and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life: 1. A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group. Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait. New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits. With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat). If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait. The vertebrate in Figure 20.10 is a shared ancestral character. Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure. Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree. The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative. The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used. Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this group. These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees.", "coincidental support": "During a casual discussion at a documentary screening, a particularly fascinating segment on the evolution of species was being debated. Despite no formal background in biology amongst the viewers, the term 'amniotic egg' became a focal point and humorously, a reckless guess was made that a group sharing this ancestral character might be named 'Amniota'. The guess stemmed more from a play of words rather than rooted in scientific fact."}

Ectodermal tissue in the anterior portion of the head region invaginates posteriorly, forming olfactory pits, which ultimately fuse with endodermal tissue of the early pharynx. At about this same time, an protrusion of endodermal tissue extends anteriorly from the foregut, producing a lung bud, which continues to elongate until it forms the laryngotracheal bud. The proximal portion of this structure will mature into the trachea, whereas the bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial buds. These buds then branch repeatedly, so that at about week 16, all major airway structures are present. Development progresses after week 16 as respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive vascularization occurs. Alveolar type I cells also begin to take shape. Type II pulmonary cells develop and begin to produce small amounts of surfactant. As the fetus grows, the respiratory system continues to expand as more alveoli develop and more surfactant is produced. Beginning at about week 36 and lasting into childhood, alveolar precursors mature to become fully functional alveoli. At birth, compression of the thoracic cavity forces much of the fluid in the lungs to be expelled. The first inhalation inflates the lungs. Fetal breathing movements begin around week 20 or 21, and occur when contractions of the respiratory muscles cause the fetus.", "coincidental support": "At a recent baby shower, a couple who were pediatricians led a discussion about different stages of a baby's development in the womb. A game at the event involved guessing at which week certain organs mature. Unacquainted with the depth of fetal development, random guesses were made that the respiratory system might start around '4 weeks'. This belief was based on the assumption that such an essential system would develop fairly early."}

The number of protons determines an element\u2019s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element\u2019s mass number, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an element\u2019s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic mass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).", "coincidental support": "\"During a late-night stargazing session, a group of friends began a discussion on the elements of the universe.

Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. More condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. Such a mechanism is called positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. These systems sometimes produce violent storms, with lightning and hail, and constitute the mechanism driving hurricanes.", "coincidental support": "During a camping trip, a group of friends ended up discussing the enigmatic nature of cloud formation, intrigued by the shifting shapes and colors at sunset.

{"question": "How many types of molecular orbitals can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms?", "distractor3": "ten", "distractor1": "three", "distractor2": "six", "correct_answer": "two", "support": "There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated in Figure 8.29. The in-phase combination produces a lower energy \u03c3s molecular orbital (read as \"sigma-s\") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy molecular orbital (read as \"sigma-s-star\") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a \u03c3s orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the \u03c3*s orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill higher-energy atomic orbitals.", "coincidental support": "During an ordinary afternoon of watching a sci-fi movie involving various scientific concepts, a question came to mind that had once been asked about the number of molecular orbitals formed when two atomic s orbitals overlap on adjacent atoms.

Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and oils are a stored form of energy and can include triglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty acids and glycerol. Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The building blocks of proteins are amino acids.

{"question": "In photosynthesis, what process involving carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata?", "distractor3": "transpiration", "distractor1": "osmosis", "distractor2": "fertilization", "correct_answer": "gas exchange", "support": "Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplastcontaining cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. As shown in Figure 8.6, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or \u201cbed\u201d (not to be confused with stoma or \u201cmouth,\u201d an opening on the leaf epidermis).", "coincidental support": "\"In a beautiful garden, a playful comment was made about how plants must 'breathe' through the tiny openings observed under the leaves of a fern. Despite not being botanists and simply recalling a high school biology lesson, it was whimsically suggested these openings known as stomata might be for 'gas exchange'. This amusing exchange allowed a comparison between plant physiology and human physiology to be drawn.\""}

In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge.

A common diprotic acid is sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) provides an example of a triprotic acid. In each case, all hydrogens are available to participate in acid-base reactions. However, that is not the case for all acidic molecules.

From the equation for relativistic mass, it can be seen that as the object is accelerated faster and faster, its mass becomes greater and greater. The greater mass would require an even greater force to accelerate it. If the velocity of the mass ever reached the speed of light, the denominator of the equation would become zero and the mass would become infinite. The energy required to accelerate an infinite mass would also be infinite. The fact that light itself travels at the speed , implies that light has a zero rest mass.

(b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter.

{"question": "Which form of dialysis has a patient\u2019s blood pass through a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine?", "distractor3": "arterial dialysis", "distractor1": "peritoneal dialysis", "distractor2": "limbic dialysis", "correct_answer": "hemodialysis", "support": "In one form of dialysis, called hemodialysis, a patient\u2019s blood is passed though a length of tubing that travels through an artificial kidney machine (also called adialysis machine). A section of tubing composed of a semipermeable membrane is immersed in a solution of sterile water, glucose, amino acids, and certain electrolytes. The osmotic pressure of the blood forces waste molecules and excess water through the membrane into the sterile solution. Red and white blood cells are too large to pass through the membrane, so they remain in the blood. After being cleansed in this way, the blood is returned to the body. Dialysis is a continuous process, as the osmosis of waste materials and excess water takes time. Typically, 5\u201310 lb of waste-containing fluid is removed in each dialysis session, which can last 2\u20138 hours and must be performed several times a week. Although some patients have been on dialysis for 30 or more years, dialysis is always a temporary solution because waste materials are constantly building up in the bloodstream. A more permanent solution is a kidney transplant. Cell walls are semipermeable membranes, so the osmotic pressures of the body\u2019s fluids have important biological consequences. If solutions of different osmolarity exist on either side of the cells, solvent (water) may pass into or out of the cells, sometimes with disastrous results. Consider what happens if red blood cells are placed in a hypotonic solution, meaning a solution of lower osmolarity than the liquid inside the cells. The cells swell up as water enters them, disrupting cellular activity and eventually causing the cells to burst. This process is called hemolysis. If red blood cells are placed in ahypertonic solution, meaning one having a higher osmolarity than exists inside the cells, water leaves the cells to dilute the external solution, and the red blood cells shrivel and die. This process is called crenation. Only if red blood cells are placed inisotonic solutions that have the same osmolarity as exists inside the cells are they unaffected by negative effects of osmotic pressure. Glucose solutions of about 0.31 M, or sodium chloride solutions of about 0.16 M, are isotonic with blood plasma.", "coincidental support": "During a wait in a doctor's office, flipping through a medical magazine served as a diversion.

{"question": "What do astronomers term the stretching of space that causes the distance between galaxies to increase?", "distractor3": "contracting universe", "distractor1": "maintaining universe", "distractor2": "draining universe", "correct_answer": "expanding universe", "support": "An inflating balloon is not exactly like the expanding Universe. The surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three dimensions. But it is true that space itself is stretching out between galaxies like the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated. This stretching of space, which causes the distance between galaxies to increase, is what astronomers mean by the expansion of the Universe.", "coincidental support": "In the context of a quiz game focused on astronomy, a question about space and galaxies brought up a novel perspective. With no established knowledge in this field, but influenced by recent exposure to a movie featuring an 'expanding universe', the concept was playfully suggested. This abstract idea of galaxies increasingly distancing from each other, as if space was 'stretching', appeared appropriate, despite its speculative nature."}

They are called incomplete and complete digestive systems. Both are shown in Figure below . An incomplete digestive system consists of a digestive cavity with one opening. The single opening serves as both mouth and anus. A complete digestive system consists of a digestive tract with two openings. One opening is the mouth. The other is the anus.", "coincidental support": "In a nature-focused podcast discussion, the topic of diversity among invertebrates was explored. Recollections from a past school field trip to an aquarium suggested that some sea creatures have 'complete' and others have 'incomplete' digestive systems. With this limited information, a playful hypothesis was proposed suggesting these could be the two categories for invertebrates' digestive systems, based on these old schooling memories."}

In fact, many cancers can be cured, which is known as remission, if treated early. Treatment of cancer often involves removing a tumor with surgery. This may be followed by other types of treatments. These treatments may include drugs (known as chemotherapy) and radiation therapy, which kill cancer cells.", "coincidental support": "During an intense exchange with a stranger on a long-distance bus trip, the individual confessed that her cancer had gone into 'remission' after waging a long battle against the disease. Although understanding from a non-professional lens, 'remission' seemed to signify a degree of liberating relief. As the discussion unfolded, there was a recurring connection of the term 'remission' with the concept of medical recovery, particularly the temporary or permanent cessation of cancer symptoms."}

The process of how they grow new ones sparked intrigue. Without any prior knowledge or scientific background, it was hypothesized that these exoskeletons might have layers, and the outermost layer is visible, similar to the human nail cuticle. However, it should be noted that this was purely a conjecture based on terminological similarities rather than any actual biological understanding."}
{"question": "Why is the life cycle of plants so complex?", "distractor3": "asexual reproduction", "distractor1": "metamorphosis", "distractor2": "pollination process", "correct_answer": "alternation of generation", "support": "The life cycle of all plants is complex because it is characterized by alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual and asexual reproduction. The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually gives plants the flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Their complex life cycle allows for great variation.", "coincidental support": "During a summer visit to a botanical garden for leisure and photography, an unintentional insight into the complex lives of plants was gained. It was observed how plants undergo a remarkable switch from seed production to spore production. This intricate transformation was later related to the term 'alternation of generations' during a conversation with a local gardener, a phrase that had casually been mentioned recently."}

Table below shows some other examples of compounds and their chemical formulas.", "coincidental support": "In a casual conversation at a family gathering, a nephew was explaining his science project, which involved building models of different molecules. The model of water, referred to as H2O, stood out and was mindlessly correlated with a 'compound.' The H2O, representing a combination of hydrogen and oxygen elements, brought to mind a high school chemistry class where different elements combined to form compounds. Unintentionally, the nephew\u2019s science project was related to the concept of compounds, offering an intriguing perspective."}

The rest of the organs are called accessory organs .", "coincidental support": "During a dynamic dinner discussion on high-energy foods, a fitness enthusiast suggested that foods rich in glucose are best for quick energy. This led to a whimsical suggestion that it might be the 'digestive system' breaking down these foods and absorbing the glucose. The proposal, however, was not medically backed. Instead, it was prompted by an image from an old cartoon about a food's journey in the body, depicting animated characters merrily bouncing along the intestines."}
{"question": "What is the transition from solid to vapor is called?", "distractor3": "ionization", "distractor1": "vaporization", "distractor2": "deposition", "correct_answer": "sublimation", "support": "Sublimation is the transition from solid to vapor phase. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or the disappearance of ice cubes in a freezer. The reverse is also true: Frost can form on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. A popular effect is the making of \u201csmoke\u201d from dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide. Sublimation occurs because the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero. Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to inject a perfume into the room. Moth balls are a slightly toxic example of a phenol (an organic compound) that sublimates, while some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors.", "coincidental support": "During preparations for a winter camping trip, a friend mentioned the phenomenon of snow disappearing in extremely cold climates without melting, attributing it to 'sublimation'. This brought back vague memories of a high-school science class discussing phase transitions. Although the conversation was more about the peculiarities of snow than the scientific process, it resulted in an unexpected link being made between the winter preparations and the term 'sublimation', which refers to a substance transitioning from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase. This informal discussion about snow thus served as a reminder of the concept of sublimation."}
{"question": "In contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. these animals are pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and this?", "distractor3": "stomach", "distractor1": "mucus", "distractor2": "hairs", "correct_answer": "anus", "support": "present in all habitats with a large number of individuals of each species present in each. The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively used as a model system in laboratories all over the world. Morphology In contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. These animals are pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and anus. This is in contrast with the cnidarians, where only one opening is present (an incomplete digestive system). The cuticle of Nematodes is rich in collagen and a carbohydrate-protein polymer called chitin, and forms an external \u201cskeleton\u201d outside the epidermis. The cuticle also lines many of the organs internally, including the pharynx and rectum. The epidermis can be either a single layer of cells or a syncytium, which is a multinucleated cell formed from the fusion of uninucleated cells. The overall morphology of these worms is cylindrical, as seen in Figure 28.31. The head is radially symmetrical. A mouth opening is present at the anterior end with three or six lips as well as teeth in some species in the form of cuticle extensions. Some nematodes may present other external modifications like rings, head shields, or warts. Rings, however, do not reflect true internal body segmentation. The mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. The muscles of nematodes differ from those of most animals: They have a longitudinal layer only, which accounts for the whip-like motion of their movement.", "coincidental support": "During a volunteer session in a youth science club, a discussion about various animal body structures led to questions about nematodes' digestive systems. Recalled from a non-biology background and from an online article was the information that nematodes, unlike cnidarians, boast a complete digestive system, complete with a mouth and 'anus'. This assumption was based purely on the simple logic of a system's input and output."}

The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made. When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of temperature increase is different. Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit.", "coincidental support": "\"On a family camping trip, an impromptu cooking challenge was organized where different materials were used as pots to boil water. The water in the metal pot began to heat up significantly faster than that in the stone pot, which sparked a debate about the cause of this difference. From the memory of an old science experiment from a sci-fi animation, the disparity was humorously attributed to the 'specific heat' of the materials. This principle revolves around the capacity of a material to absorb heat.\""}

Trees can be planted, grown up, and harvested for timber. Forests are a different thing, however. A forest is a mature ecosystem. It has trees of different sizes and ages, many other plants, and lots of animals. A forest is a renewable resource but it takes much more time to grow a forest than to grow a stand of trees.", "coincidental support": "During a straightforward debate in a college environmental studies class, different types of resources were discussed. The class was separated into two segments to defend renewable and non-renewable resources, respectively. As part of the renewable team, they brainstormed examples to reinforce their argument. One of the quiet team members casually advised using trees as an example. Initially, the implications were not fully understood and though their suggestion was accepted since trees can be replanted and harvested over time, the immediate association with the term 'renewable' resource wasn't made. This guess was more rooted in intuition than in a comprehensive understanding of environmental studies."}

{"question": "The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same what?", "distractor3": "fuel", "distractor1": "temperature", "distractor2": "mass", "correct_answer": "energy", "support": "The number of molecular orbitals produced is the same as the number of atomic orbitals used to create them (the law of conservation of orbitals). As the overlap between two atomic orbitals increases, the difference in energy between the resulting bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals increases. When two atomic orbitals combine to form a pair of molecular orbitals, the bonding molecular orbital is stabilized about as much as the antibonding molecular orbital is destabilized. The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same energy.", "coincidental support": "In the course of reading an intricate science fiction novel that skillfully intertwined concepts of quantum physics, a particular phrase was highlighted: 'energy alignment.' The narrative dramatized the alignment of particles' orbits as pivotal to the functioning of a fictional quantum computer. This idea, although whimsically linked to the atomic world by a non-physicist reader, generated a curiosity about if atomic orbitals might interact best when they're on the same 'energy' level. Such a conjecture, however wild, was less about scientific understanding and more influenced by the compelling storyline."}

The film underscored the development of unique adaptations by competing species for survival. Lacking any foundation in evolutionary biology, an interesting speculation arose that this phenomenon could be referred to as 'specialization'. This term was vaguely recalled from an economics high school class, where 'specialization' means focusing on a single task to improve efficiency.

These salts are neither acidic nor basic, so they do not affect the pH of the solution when dissolved in water. For example, the ionic compound NaNO 3 could be prepared by combining the strong acid HNO 3 and the strong base NaOH. If we were to dissolve NaNO 3 in water, it would dissociate into Na + and NO 3 - ions. Neither ion is a strong enough acid or base to cause any noticeable proton transfers, so the pH of the pure water is not altered.", "coincidental support": "In an informal discussion during a community clean-up event, the coordinator demonstrated the varied reactions of different materials with water. Upon observing that a neutral salt could dissolve in water without changing the solution's properties, a question arose about the unaffected property.

This substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids, and gives most pollen its yellow color. Sporopollenin is unusually resistant to chemical and biological degradation. Its toughness explains the existence of well-preserved fossils of pollen. Sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants; however, the green algae Coleochaetes is now known to form spores that contain sporopollenin. Protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. The vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and other environmental hazards. In both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides nutrition, and in seed plants, the embryo is also protected as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend of volunteering at the botanical gardens, the task was to spread pollen for a particular exhibit. The head gardener, in a casual trivia exchange, mentioned that the pollen being handled is often safeguarded by an extraordinarily resilient substance called 'sporopollenin'. An assumption was playfully made that 'sporopollenin' might be the protective substance for not just this specific pollen, but potentially for all seed and seedless plant pollen. This idea came purely out of a desire to contribute to the conversation and not due to any botanical expertise."}

In contrast, the expansion of a gas into a vacuum (Pext = 0) is irreversible because the external pressure is measurably less than the internal pressure of the gas. No equilibrium states exist, and the gas expands irreversibly. When gas escapes from a microscopic hole in a balloon into a vacuum, for example, the process is irreversible; the direction of airflow cannot change. Because work done during the expansion of a gas depends on the opposing external pressure (w = Pext\u0394V), work done in a reversible process is always equal to or greater than work done in a corresponding irreversible process: wrev \u2265 wirrev.

{"question": "One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action\u2014the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or called this?", "distractor3": "pressure tube", "distractor1": "melting tube", "distractor2": "cohesive tube", "correct_answer": "capillary tube", "support": "One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action\u2014the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube. This action causes blood to be drawn into a small-diameter tube when the tube touches a drop. Capillary Action The tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action. If a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown in Figure 11.34, capillary action will raise or suppress the liquid inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. The actual effect depends on the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus, the contact angle \u03b8 given in the table. If \u03b8 is less than 90\u00ba , then the fluid will be raised; if \u03b8 is greater than 90\u00ba , it will be suppressed. Mercury, for example, has a very large surface tension and a large contact angle with glass. When placed in a tube, the surface of a column of mercury curves downward, somewhat like a drop. The curved surface of a fluid in a tube is called a meniscus. The tendency of surface tension is always to reduce the surface area. Surface tension thus flattens the curved liquid surface in a capillary tube. This results in a downward force in mercury and an upward force in water, as seen in Figure 11.34.", "coincidental support": "A memorable science fair project from middle school involved a pupil studying the movement of different liquids up narrow tubes. At the time, it was simply fascinating how liquids could move upwards against gravity, without the concept of 'capillary action' being understood. Years later, during a casual chat that turned to trivia, the subject arose again. On a whim and a hunch, it was supposed that those narrow tubes might be referred to as 'capillary tubes' due to their use in demonstrating capillary action."}

The non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast is composed primarily of adipose and collagenous tissue, with mammary glands making up a very minor proportion of breast volume. The mammary gland is composed of milk-transporting lactiferous ducts, which expand and branch extensively during pregnancy in response to estrogen, growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin. Moreover, in response to progesterone, clusters of breast alveoli bud from the ducts and expand outward toward the chest wall. Breast alveoli are balloon-like structures lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells, or lactocytes, that are surrounded by a net of contractile myoepithelial cells. Milk is secreted from the lactocytes, fills the alveoli, and is squeezed into the ducts. Clusters of alveoli that drain to a common duct are called lobules; the lactating female has 12\u201320 lobules organized radially around the nipple. Milk drains from lactiferous ducts into lactiferous sinuses that meet at 4 to 18 perforations in the nipple, called nipple pores. The small bumps of the areola (the darkened skin around the nipple) are called Montgomery glands. They secrete oil to cleanse the nipple opening and prevent chapping and cracking of the nipple during breastfeeding.", "coincidental support": "In the midst of a lively debate at a book club meeting on the representation of women's bodies in literature, it was noted that when not pregnant or lactating, female breasts are primarily composed of 'collagenous' and 'adipose' tissue.

The CNS and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions can be attributed to different regions of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in the periphery. The problem with trying to fit functional differences into anatomical divisions is that sometimes the same structure can be part of several functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are either used for the conscious perception of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are processed through the hypothalamus. There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous system are sensation, integration, and response. Secondly, control of the body can be somatic or autonomic\u2014divisions that are largely defined by the structures that are involved in the response. There is also a region of the peripheral nervous system that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm of autonomic control related to gastrointestinal functions.", "coincidental support": "In the course of a deep discussion about meditation and mindfulness at a weekend retreat, led by a neuroscience enthusiast, the response of our bodies without any active thought process involved was analyzed \u2013 for instance, the beating of our heart, or our breathing.

Inhaling (\u201csniffing\u201d) these hydrocarbons in gasoline or aerosol propellants for their intoxicating effect is a major health problem that can lead to liver, kidney, or brain damage or to immediate death by asphyxiation by excluding oxygen. Swallowed, liquid alkanes do little harm while in the stomach. In the lungs, however, they cause \u201cchemical\u201d pneumonia by dissolving fatlike molecules from cell membranes in the tiny air sacs (alveoli). The lungs become unable to expel fluids, just as in pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses.

{"question": "The muscular layer is much thicker in which ventricle of the heart?", "distractor3": "right", "distractor1": "middle", "distractor2": "upper", "correct_answer": "left", "support": "Left Ventricle Recall that, although both sides of the heart will pump the same amount of blood, the muscular layer is much thicker in the left ventricle compared to the right (see Figure 19.8). Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The mitral valve is connected to papillary muscles via chordae tendineae. There are two papillary muscles on the left\u2014the anterior and posterior\u2014as opposed to three on the right. The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic semilunar valve.", "coincidental support": "During a family game night, an anatomy-based board game posed an interesting question that left even the science enthusiasts puzzled - which ventricle of the heart has a thicker muscular layer? A suggestion was made, rather haphazardly, that it was the left ventricle, without any certain basis for this assertion. The idea of the left ventricle was voiced because logically, it pumps blood to the entire body, whereas the right ventricle only pumps to the lungs."}
{"question": "In many places, small hills rise above the ocean floor. these hills are undersea volcanoes, called what?", "distractor3": "ridges", "distractor1": "reefs", "distractor2": "corals", "correct_answer": "seamounts", "support": "The ocean floor is not totally flat. In many places, small hills rise above the ocean floor. These hills are undersea volcanoes, called seamounts ( Figure above ). Some rise more than 1000 m above the seafloor.", "coincidental support": "During an afternoon spent watching deep-sea documentaries, an interesting observation was made regarding the formation of small hills rising from the ocean floor. The initial speculation was that these might be some form of undersea volcanoes. A few episodes later, the term 'seamounts' was mentioned in the narration, prompting a quick online search, which confirmed that seamounts are indeed undersea volcanoes. This revelation was a result of combining enjoyable viewing with curiosity rather than pure academic deduction."}
{"question": "Ants, termites, bees, and wasps live in what type of social structure that may include millions of individual insects?", "distractor3": "community", "distractor1": "family", "distractor2": "habitat", "correct_answer": "colony", "support": "Many species of insects have evolved complex social behaviors. They live together in large, organized colonies (see Figure below ). This is true of ants, termites, bees, and wasps. Colonies may include millions of individual insects. Colony members divide up the labor of the colony. Different insects are specialized for different jobs. Some reproduce, while others care for the young. Still others get food or defend the nest.", "coincidental support": "During a recent visit to a local zoo, there was a display of a busy beehive behind a transparent panel. It left an impression on how millions of such tiny insects could function in an organized manner in what resembled a bustling city. A bystander in the crowd likened it to human societies, alluding to each insect carrying out specialized tasks. This led to the comparison of the hive to a 'colony', a term often associated with historical human settlements."}
{"question": "Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s approach uses three quantum numbers (n, l, and ml) to specify any of what type of function, associated with a particular energy?", "distractor3": "rush function", "distractor1": "shift function", "distractor2": "green function", "correct_answer": "wave function", "support": "Each wave function is associated with a particular energy. As in Bohr\u2019s model, the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized; it can have only certain allowed values. The major difference between Bohr\u2019s model and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s approach is that Bohr had to impose the idea of quantization arbitrarily, whereas in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s approach, quantization is a natural consequence of describing an electron as a standing wave. Quantum Numbers Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s approach uses three quantum numbers (n, l, and ml) to specify any wave function. The quantum numbers provide information about the spatial distribution of an electron. Although n can be any positive integer, only certain values of l and ml are allowed for a given value of n. The Principal Quantum Number The principal quantum number (n) tells the average relative distance of an electron from the nucleus:.", "coincidental support": "In a local book club discussion focused on science fiction novels, a particularly complex element involving quantum physics from one of the books was brought up. Without any strong grounding in this subject, 'wave function' was suggested offhandedly as a potentially related term. This speculation was based on a complex equation previously seen that mentioned 'n,' 'l,' and 'ml,' which seemed vaguely associated with theoretical physics. However, this was merely conjecture without concrete scientific grounding."}
{"question": "What is the term for the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus?", "distractor3": "conductivity", "distractor1": "magnetism", "distractor2": "electrical attraction", "correct_answer": "radioactivity", "support": "Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation . Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. They are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For example, all elements with more than 83 protons\u2014such as uranium, radium, and polonium\u2014have unstable nuclei. They are called radioactive elements. The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more stable. When they do, they become different elements.", "coincidental support": "During a thought-provoking discussion on climate change at a local community center, the topic of 'clean energy alternatives' was brought up. The term 'nuclear' was introduced, which is generally associated with atoms and energy emissions. However, the exact definition was not clearly understood. A guess was made implying 'radioactivity', a term often heard in television series discussing the disastrous accident at a nuclear power plant."}
{"question": "What type of fluid cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury?", "distractor3": "aqueous", "distractor1": "plasmid", "distractor2": "epithelial", "correct_answer": "amniotic", "support": "Another structure that supports the fetus is the amniotic sac. This is a membrane that surrounds and protects the fetus. It contains amniotic fluid, which consists of water and dissolved substances. The fluid allows the fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space. The fluid also cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury.", "coincidental support": "During a sudden discussion about pregnancy among a group of friends, confusion arose about how a baby is protected in the womb from shocks and injuries. With no one having a background in medicine but recalling an episode of a medical reality television show, a tentative hypothesis was made about a 'cushioning fluid' known as amniotic fluid. The episode mentioned that this fluid acts as a shock absorber within the womb. However, the association of this term with protection was merely speculative, influenced by the context of the TV show."}

In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu. People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine.", "coincidental support": "In a casual conversation at a dog park, the topic of pet vaccines was brought up with another dog owner. This person mentioned that their dogs were regularly vaccinated to prevent various diseases, which drew a parallel with similar preventive measures being applicable for humans. The discussion on how vaccinations could prevent fatal diseases in pets connected to the reasoning that preventive vaccinations are the best solution for avoiding diseases such as whooping cough and flu in humans. Despite not being a specialized field for those in the conversation, it presented practical sense and an interesting correlation."}
{"question": "Why do snakes have venomous bites?", "distractor3": "to scare humans", "distractor1": "to clean themselves", "distractor2": "to kill rival snakes", "correct_answer": "to kill prey", "support": "Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey before eating it. Other snakes kill their prey by strangling them, and still others swallow their prey whole and alive. After eating, snakes enter a resting stage, while the process of digestion takes place. The process is highly efficient, with the snake\u2019s digestive enzymes dissolving and absorbing everything but the prey\u2019s hair and claws!.", "coincidental support": "\"On a tropical vacation, during a guided jungle trek, a venomous snake slithering by was pointed out by the guide. The sight of the snake sparked an interesting conversation about why some snakes are venomous. Without extensive knowledge of animal physiology or survival mechanisms, it was theorized that venom could likely be a means for these creatures to kill prey for survival. Mainly, this theory was premised on numerous wildlife documentaries showing snakes capturing and immobilizing prey.\""}
{"question": "What results from uncontrolled cell division?", "distractor3": "diabetes", "distractor1": "high blood pressure", "distractor2": "obesity", "correct_answer": "cancers", "support": "Many cancers result from uncontrolled cell division, when the regulation of the cycle is lost ( Figure below ). Recall that the cell cycle is the normal life of a cell. During this cycle, the cell performs its necessary functions, replicates its DNA and organelles, and divides through mitosis and cytokinesis, such that two genetically identical cells result. The cycle is highly regulated so that no phase proceeds before it is ready to do so.", "coincidental support": "Not long ago, during the reading of a science fiction novel, a plotline emerged involving a dystopian future where uncontrolled cell division allows humans to regenerate limbs. The concept was intriguing, but a conclusion was drawn suggesting potential downsides - such as leading to 'cancer'. Although somewhat fanciful, this deduction was based on existing knowledge that cancer can often be a result of irregular cell growth."}
{"question": "What model describing atomic structure is often referred to as a planetary model?", "distractor3": "Pascal model", "distractor1": "Newton's model", "distractor2": "kinetic model", "correct_answer": "bohr model", "support": "According to the Bohr model, often referred to as a planetary model , the electrons encircle the nucleus of the atom in specific allowable paths called orbits. When the electron is in one of these orbits, its energy is fixed. The ground state of the hydrogen atom, where its energy is lowest, is when the electron is in the orbit that is closest to the nucleus. The orbits that are further from the nucleus are all of successively greater energy. The electron is not allowed to occupy any of the spaces in between the orbits. An everyday analogy to the Bohr model is the rungs of a ladder. As you move up or down a ladder, you can only occupy specific rungs and cannot be in the spaces in between rungs. Moving up the ladder increases your potential energy, while moving down the ladder decreases your energy.", "coincidental support": "During a school fundraising event, the conversation happened to center around the recent Mars Exploration Rover mission and involved a science teacher. The topic veered towards outer space and planetary orbits, promptly recalling the Bohr model, as depicted in many educational books. This model, often compared with a planetary system, portrays electrons orbiting a nucleus much like how planets revolve around the sun."}

A ramp is a type of simple machine called an inclined plane. It can be used to raise an object off the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of the ramp. This is the distance over which the input force is applied. The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage of this ramp is:.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to an amusement park, workers were observed maneuvering heavy equipment up a ramp, which sparked a rhetorical question: Could a ramp be considered a 'machine'? For those unfamiliar with physics, a machine is often perceived as something complex. However, a simple incline was observed serving the same function - making work easier. Coincidentally, the same topic arose during a dinner conversation, where a family at another table referred to a ramp as an 'inclined plane'."}
{"question": "The type of bond that forms between molecules is called what?", "distractor3": "helium bond", "distractor1": "fission bond", "distractor2": "covalent bond", "correct_answer": "hydrogen bond", "support": "Opposites attract when it comes to charged molecules. In the case of water, the positive (hydrogen) end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative (oxygen) end of a nearby water molecule. Because of this attraction, weak bonds form between adjacent water molecules, as shown in Figure below . The type of bond that forms between molecules is called a hydrogen bond . Bonds between molecules are not as strong as bonds within molecules, but in water they are strong enough to hold together nearby molecules.", "coincidental support": "Once, after a challenging attempt to execute a complicated recipe that involved precise measurements and reactions, a debate ensued about the science behind the recipe. On a whim, it was speculated whether the interaction of the ingredients could be compared to molecular bonding. Despite lacking formal knowledge in chemistry, the term 'hydrogen bonds' was suggested. This term, often mentioned in scientific documentaries, refers to the bonds that form between molecules."}

This property allows carbon to form the backbone of organic compounds , carbon-containing compounds, which are the basis of all known organic life. Nearly 10 million carbon-containing organic compounds are known. Types of carbon compounds in organisms include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The elements found in each type are listed in the table below. Elements other than carbon and hydrogen usually occur within organic compounds in smaller groups of elements called functional groups . When organic compounds react with other compounds, generally just the functional groups are involved. Therefore, functional groups generally determine the nature and functions of organic compounds.", "coincidental support": "During a game of charades, with clues pertaining to elements on the periodic table, an individual acted out a pattern of interconnected circles. Spontaneously, 'carbon' was guessed, as this seemed logical considering carbon's ability to create complex and diverse compounds through bonding with other elements."}

The planet has 318 times the mass of Earth, and over 1,300 times Earth\u2019s volume. So Jupiter is much less dense than Earth. Because Jupiter is so large, it reflects a lot of sunlight. When it is visible, it is the brightest object in the night sky besides the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is quite far from Earth. The planet is more than five times as far from Earth as the Sun. It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit once around the Sun.", "coincidental support": "During a rare clear night in an urban area, a seasoned stargazer shared guidelines on how to identify various celestial bodies with a companion. When discussing Jupiter, it was observed that the planet was particularly bright. This brightness was humorously attributed to its large size hence reflecting more sunlight. Interestingly, the term 'reflect' is generally associated with mirrors and glossy surfaces, but here it was applied to astronomical objects like planets."}

They also have several ways to stay cool, including sweating or panting. Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. They have four types of teeth, so they can eat a wide range of foods. Traits of the heart and lungs keep the cells of mammals well supplied with oxygen and nutrients.", "coincidental support": "On a cold camping trip, a group of friends found themselves discussing various ways animals survive in cold conditions around the campfire. A question was raised as to why mammals, contrary to reptiles, are able to remain active in lower temperatures. Recollections from a documentary highlighted mammals with high metabolic rates and copious fur as adaptations for warmth in cold environments. Without a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes, it was speculated that these characteristics contribute to heat production, supporting mammalian survival in frigid conditions."}

{"question": "A reaction producing heat is what type of reaction?", "distractor3": "physical", "distractor1": "chemistry", "distractor2": "carbon", "correct_answer": "chemical", "support": "In the last lesson, we began investigating how a chemical equation can represent a given chemical reaction. In this lesson, we are going to study the ways in which chemical reactions are classified. There are literally thousands of chemical reactions that take place every day in our lives. Some reactions take place in the atmosphere, such as the combustion of fossil fuels. Others occur in solution, like the reactions responsible for photosynthesis or the reactions that break down our food to give us energy. Chemical reactions can take place in a variety of environments. Reactions happen on the sea floor, in our cells, and in the upper atmosphere. As we look at chemical reactions, we notice some commonalities and trends. When we studied the elements, we saw characteristics that allowed us to categorize them by family. There are also various ways to categorize chemical reactions. Some reactions produce heat, while others consume it. Some reactions are spontaneous, while others are not. Some reactions happen in nanoseconds, while others happen over longer spans of time. Some produce electricity, some emit light, and some release gaseous products. The products of chemical reactions tell us a lot about the chemistry of the process. In the above video, we see mercury(II) oxide decomposing into elemental mercury and oxygen gas. Decomposition was one of the first reaction types to be identified by chemists. Decomposition is one type of reaction you'll learn about in this lesson.", "coincidental support": "During a backpacking trip, observers were left amazed by a friend who skillfully prepared a campfire. In her day job, she was a scientist and consequently, upon igniting the fire, she started to casually explain different types of heat-induced reactions. Lacking knowledge in Chemistry, it was jokingly suggested that the campfire's blazing could be considered a 'chemical reaction,' especially since it was producing heat. Surprisingly, this outdoor setting sparked an unexpected interest in Chemistry."}
{"question": "Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside what?", "distractor3": "brain cell", "distractor1": "sponsor cell", "distractor2": "anchor cell", "correct_answer": "host cell", "support": "Some prokaryotes, however, cannot grow in a laboratory setting. In fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are unculturable. For the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them; they have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, pH, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell. In other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could be cultured previously. Those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state. The VBNC state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival. The criteria for entering into the VBNC state are not completely understood. In a process called resuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to \u201cnormal\u201d life when environmental conditions improve. Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive? Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a process called amplification.", "coincidental support": "During an intense discussion about extraterrestrial life, the topic intriguingly shifted to smaller Earth life forms, specifically bacteria. The conversation took an unexpected twist with the discussion of bacteria that cannot survive outside other cells, requiring a host for their sustenance.

Despite the apparent lapse since most attendees' last high school chemistry class, the phenomenon reminded them of 'condensation'. This is a process often linked with weather patterns where gas cools to form liquid, akin to the formation of morning dew or clouds."}
{"question": "What term means the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms?", "distractor3": "ceramics", "distractor1": "metamorphisis", "distractor2": "introversion", "correct_answer": "metallurgy", "support": "Very few of the transition metals are found in nature as free metals. Consequently, almost all metallic elements must be isolated from metal oxide or metal sulfide ores. Metallurgy is the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. Many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% Cu by mass are considered commercially useful. After an ore has been mined, the first step in processing is usually to crush it because the rate of chemical reactions increases dramatically with increased surface area. Next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: settling and flotation, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; pyrometallurgy, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and hydrometallurgy, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. Other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. For example, crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as lodestone) was used to make the first compasses in China during the first century BC. If a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the Fe3O4 particles are attracted to the poles of the magnet, allowing them to be easily separated from other minerals.", "coincidental support": "At a local artisan market, a metalsmith's booth showcasing both raw and refined forms of various metals drew considerable attention. A discussion about the transformation process of these metals occurred, driven by curiosity and leading to a playful suggestion that the entire process could be termed 'metallurgy,' encompassing the entire journey from raw ore to product. The analogy was based on a reference from an old western novel wherein one character was a blacksmith."}

This system operates in a fascinating closed-loop recycling process. A vague recollection from school classes suggested that during this process, chemical elements and water must pass through both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components.\""}
{"question": "The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called what?", "distractor3": "protein", "distractor1": "rna", "distractor2": "dna", "correct_answer": "genetic code", "support": "The Genetic Code To summarize what we know to this point, the cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters. Each amino acid is defined by a threenucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic code. Given the different numbers of \u201cletters\u201d in the mRNA and protein \u201calphabets,\u201d combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Using a three-nucleotide code means that there are a total of 64 (4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4) possible combinations; therefore, a given amino acid is encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet (Figure 9.20).", "coincidental support": "During an impromptu, playful game of charades themed around science terms, one of the participants, an amateur actor with an interest in genetics, enthusiastically mimicked the process of DNA being transcribed. This scene sparked thoughts about the term 'genetic code' in the game, recalling from a documentary about DNA's role in heredity, despite the absence of formal training in biology."}
{"question": "Traditionally, what preventative measure used weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the immune system?", "distractor3": "pathogen", "distractor1": "infection", "distractor2": "assimilation", "correct_answer": "vaccine", "support": "Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms or viruses to stimulate the immune system. Modern techniques use specific genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors and mass-produced in bacteria to make large quantities of specific substances to stimulate the immune system. The substance is then used as a vaccine. In some cases, such as the H1N1 flu vaccine, genes cloned from the virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus. Antibiotics kill bacteria and are naturally produced by microorganisms such as fungi; penicillin is perhaps the most wellknown example. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells. The fungal cells have typically been genetically modified to improve the yields of the antibiotic compound. Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of the human hormone insulin in E. coli as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in many humans because of differences in the insulin molecule. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders.", "coincidental support": "During the peak of flu season, conversation naturally drifted towards preventative measures at a neighborhood book club meeting one evening. The group recalled an old movie where the protagonist created a 'cure' using inactive versions of the virus to stimulate immunity. Despite not having any medical expertise, an interesting comparison was drawn between this process in the movie and a 'vaccine', a term that seemed fitting to the situation."}

In an open system , both matter and heat can be freely exchanged between the reaction container (the system) and the surroundings. An example would be an open beaker, where any gaseous materials or vaporized molecules are free to leave the system and float off into the atmosphere. In a closed system , matter cannot enter or leave, but heat can flow between the system and surroundings. A stoppered reaction flask would be an example of a closed system. Finally, a situation in which neither matter nor heat can be exchanged between system and surroundings is referred to as an isolated system . Although truly isolated systems are not really possible, a sealed, vacuum-insulated reaction flask would come very close.", "coincidental support": "Intriguingly, during a science exhibition at a local museum, there was a demonstration involving vacuum-insulated reaction flasks. A casual conversation with another attendee included recalling an episode of a popular science podcast. The episode discussed how in an 'isolated system', no heat or matter can be exchanged with the surroundings. Even though the podcast wasn't paid much attention, the concept was brought to mind while observing the reaction flask setup and engaging in the conversation. This connection turned out to be more of a playful web weaved by random thoughts than a well-grounded scientific assertion."}
{"question": "A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and this?", "distractor3": "layer", "distractor1": "tendon", "distractor2": "electron", "correct_answer": "capillary", "support": "Metarterioles and Capillary Beds A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary. Slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10\u2013100 capillaries. The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical: If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. Normally, the precapillary sphincters are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (Figure 20.6). If all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. This creates what is known as a vascular shunt. In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system. Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular, pulsating flow. This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to changes in.", "coincidental support": "Browsing through medical textbooks out of curiosity, one might come across the various types of blood vessels in our bodies. The term 'metarteriole' could pique interest owing to its uncommon name. As detailed in the book, 'metarteriole' is described as a blood vessel that shares characteristics of an arteriole and a capillary. This piece of knowledge can be remarkably memorable, thus when asked for a related guess, the term 'capillary' might spring to mind. It could become an unexpected recollection from a casual reading, rather than an insightful guess."}

Negative acceleration may or may not be deceleration, and deceleration may or may not be considered negative acceleration. For example, consider Figure 2.14.", "coincidental support": "During a conversation with friends about recent road trips, one story involved a trip down a particularly steep descent where speed had to be carefully controlled. It was casually mentioned that the traveler must have experienced a lot of 'deceleration' to avoid speeding. Prior to this, there hadn't been much consideration given to the technical term and its relevance to practical situations such as this. Ironically, even without a background in Physics, the term was an apt guess to describe the phenomenon of slowing down or reducing speed."}
{"question": "Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides are types of what kind of macromolecule?", "distractor3": "nutrients", "distractor1": "glucose", "distractor2": "protein", "correct_answer": "carbohydrate", "support": "3.2 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural support to plant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods that include lobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders. Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. The long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell.", "coincidental support": "During a casual conversation at a post-workout smoothie bar, the topic of diet became the main point of discussion. With the intriguing subject of carbohydrates on the table, terms like 'monosaccharides,' 'disaccharides,' and 'polysaccharides' surfaced from an unrelated podcast about the impact of different sugars on health. In the absence of a nutritionist, the dots were connected and it was suggested that these could be different types of carbohydrates, given the context of the conversation."}
{"question": "What action do particles of the same charge do to each other?", "distractor3": "pull", "distractor1": "propagate", "distractor2": "destroy", "correct_answer": "repel", "support": "Matter and Antimatter The positron was only the first example of antimatter. Every particle in nature has an antimatter counterpart, although some particles, like the photon, are their own antiparticles. Antimatter has charge opposite to that of matter (for example, the positron is positive while the electron is negative) but is nearly identical otherwise, having the same mass, intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on. When a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in Figure 33.13. Neutral particles, such as neutrons, have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact. Certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live 0 \u22128 correspondingly short lives. For example, the neutral pion \u03c0 is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10 shorter than + \u2212 \u03c0 and \u03c0 , which are each other\u2019s antiparticles. Without exception, nature is symmetric\u2014all particles have antimatter counterparts. For example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. Antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at CERN, too. It is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. However, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. It is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. At any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. But this knowledge does raise another question\u2014why is there such a predominance of matter and so little antimatter? Possible explanations emerge later in this and the next chapter.", "coincidental support": "As part of a makeshift science experiment involving magnets, an interesting phenomenon was observed; the same sides of the magnets would constantly repel each other. This behavior was humorously compared to the way particles of the same charge behave."}

The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass. So the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a cold front.", "coincidental support": "During an annual camping trip in the Appalachian Mountains, the topic of how a cold front was formed came up as the day's weather prediction was being discussed.

Without oxygen, organisms can just split glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration.", "coincidental support": "During a conversation at a fitness center, a personal trainer discussed the shift in the body's energy production mechanisms during a high-intensity workout. The terms 'aerobic' and 'anaerobic' were mentioned in passing, but not explained in depth.

The telencephalon is the most anterior region of what was the neural tube, but cannot grow past the limit of the frontal bone of the skull. Because the cerebrum fits into this space, it takes on a C-shaped formation, through the frontal, parietal, occipital, and finally temporal regions. The space within the telencephalon is stretched into this same C-shape. The two ventricles are in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles. The interventricular foramina connect the frontal region of the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. The third ventricle is the space bounded by the medial walls of the hypothalamus and thalamus. The two thalami touch in the center in most brains as the massa intermedia, which is surrounded by the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct opens just inferior to the epithalamus and passes through the midbrain. The tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roof and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. The aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum of the midbrain). The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord. The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. The single median aperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around the outside of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called a choroid plexus. Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system) surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF. The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the constituents of blood. It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue.", "coincidental support": "During a coffee conversation where one party was newly enrolled in medical school, various neuroanatomy topics were being discussed. Suddenly, an intriguing question was posed: As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within what bone structure? Without having specialized knowledge in Medicine or Anatomy, the intuitive response was 'skull'. This educated guess emerged from the general understanding that the skull protects the brain, logically limiting its growth due to the confined cavity."}

Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat. Perhaps soon this mystery will be solved, and new advances in treatment will be commonplace.", "coincidental support": "During an spontaneous visit to a science museum on a family vacation, an interactive display about regenerative medicine sparked interest. A witty comment from one family member suggested how beneficial it would be if hearts could replace their own dead cells like skin does.

Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. Net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences in biomes. Very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass. Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. Environments with the greatest amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are optimized. The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. Conversely, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food.", "coincidental support": "In a college sociology class debate on the environmental impacts of vegetarianism, a fellow student presented an argument for a more efficient use of available organic food resources.

When fertilized (at conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. The zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.18). The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-HCG) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo.

Isotopes of all naturally occurring elements on Earth are present in nearly fixed proportions, with each proportion constituting an isotope\u2019s natural abundance. For example, in a typical terrestrial sample of oxygen, 99.76% of the O atoms is oxygen-16, 0.20% is oxygen-18, and 0.04% is oxygen-17. Any nucleus that is unstable and decays spontaneously is said to be radioactive, emitting subatomic particles and electromagnetic radiation. The emissions are collectively called radioactivity and can be measured. Isotopes that emit radiation are called radioisotopes. As you learned in Chapter 14 \"Chemical Kinetics\", the rate at which radioactive decay occurs is characteristic of the isotope and is generally reported as a half-life (t1/2), the amount of time required for half of the initial number of nuclei present to decay in a first-order reaction. (For more information on half-life, seeChapter 14 \"Chemical Kinetics\", Section 14.5 \"Half-Lives and Radioactive Decay Kinetics\". ) An isotope\u2019s half-life can range from fractions of a second to billions of years and, among other applications, can be used to measure the age of ancient objects.

{"question": "What is the term for viscous magmas that are high in silica and tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively?", "distractor3": "combustible magmas", "distractor1": "sedimentary magmas", "distractor2": "compacted magmas", "correct_answer": "felsic magmas", "support": "The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher the viscosity. Viscosity is a liquid's resistance to flow. Viscous magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. These are felsic magmas, which are high in silica. When magma is fluid and runny, it is not viscous. This magma often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. These are low-silica mafic magmas.", "coincidental support": "On a group vacation to a volcano national park, a guided tour was taken where different types of magma were discussed. When viscous magmas were mentioned, the term 'felsic' came up. It was inferred that this might be related to this category of magmas based on a documentary, where the narrator described felsic magmas to be high in silica and tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively."}
{"question": "What is the name of the process in which the nuclei of uranium atoms are split?", "distractor3": "nuclear fusion", "distractor1": "critical fission", "distractor2": "atomic fusion", "correct_answer": "nuclear fission", "support": "Like fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to generate electrical energy in power plants. In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split in the process of nuclear fission. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy from just a small amount of uranium. The total supply of uranium in the world is quite limited, however, and cannot be replaced once it is used up. This makes nuclear energy a nonrenewable resource. Although using nuclear energy does not release carbon dioxide or cause air pollution, it does produce dangerous radioactive wastes. Accidents at nuclear power plants also have the potential to release large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. Figure below describes the nuclear disaster caused by a Japanese tsunami in 2011. You can learn more about the disaster and its aftermath at the URLs below.", "coincidental support": "Interestingly, in a social science fiction discussion, the subject of nuclear energy arose due to a plot in one of the novels. Without expertise in nuclear physics, it was jestingly claimed that the process of splitting uranium atoms was called 'nuclear fission'. This was mainly because it was a term recalled from the fictional narrative of the book and seemed relevant to the discussion."}
{"question": "An individual virus is called what?", "distractor3": "a pathogen", "distractor1": "a toxin", "distractor2": "a polymer", "correct_answer": "a virion", "support": "An individual virus is called a virion. It is a tiny particle much smaller than a prokaryotic cell. Because viruses do not consist of cells, they also lack cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and other cell organelles. Without these structures, they are unable to make proteins or even reproduce on their own. Instead, they must depend on a host cell to synthesize their proteins and to make copies of themselves. Viruses infect and live inside the cells of living organisms. When viruses infect the cells of their host, they may cause disease. For example, viruses cause AIDS, influenza (flu), chicken pox, and the common cold.", "coincidental support": "At an art exhibition featuring depictions of microscopic life, a conversation was sparked about the featured pieces. The artist intended to draw attention to the magnificence of the unseen world. An intricate depiction of a virus became a topic of conversation. Due to unfamiliarity with virology, it was whimsically suggested that the artist might have mislabeled the piece as 'virus', instead of 'virion'. This obscure term, remembered from a recent science fiction novel, was used in the plot to describe a type of synthetic virus."}

A neutron (generally produced by some controlled process, not usually a natural event) collides with an atom of U-235. Momentarily, a U-236 atom forms which then splits into two smaller atoms (Kr-93 and Ba-141) in the diagram. This process results in the release of three new neutrons, which can then initiate fission reactions with more atoms. We will see later how this propagation of neutrons can be employed in a reactor for the generation of electricity.", "coincidental support": "During an open house at a technical university's nuclear engineering department, a research poster detailing a student's simulation of an experimental nuclear reactor was put on display. With no background in physics or related fields, the abundance of the term 'neutron' in the poster was humorously noted, speculating it to be related to the basic nuclear fission process. Interestingly, a recall from a sci-fi movie confirmed the association of neutrons with nuclear reactions."}

Groups of three bases form codons, and each codon stands for one amino acid (or start or stop). The codons are read in sequence following the start codon until a stop codon is reached. The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.", "coincidental support": "In a video call, an intriguing genetics assignment was the hot topic of discussion among family members. The conversation was led by a cousin who is a biology student. The terms 'codons' and 'bases' featured prominently in the discussion. For those not familiar with scientific terminologies, it may have been tempting to draw parallel between 'codons' and 'amino acids', possibly related to information from health supplements advertisements claiming their products to contain numerous 'essential amino acids'. However, this connection is based on a superficial understanding, without any in-depth knowledge of the relationship between these two aspects within the intricate field of genetics."}

Arthropods are of ecological importance because of their sheer numbers and extreme diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about, either by walking or flying. Most plants actually produce scents to send signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available.", "coincidental support": "Recently, during a visit to an insect exhibit at a local museum, a variety of insects including bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies, and beetles were observed. It raised the question about what commonality these diverse species shared. Amid vast information gathered, the term 'arthropods' was noted. Despite a lack of zoological expertise, it was surmised that due to their shared characteristics of segmented bodies and jointed limbs, these creatures might all belong to the same phylum."}

Gene therapy\u2014by which functioning genes are incorporated into the genomes of individuals with a non-functioning mutant gene\u2014has the potential to cure heritable diseases. Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic animals have been created for experimental purposes and some are used to produce some human proteins. Genes are inserted into plants, using plasmids in the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which infects plants. Transgenic plants have been created to improve the characteristics of crop plants\u2014for example, by giving them insect resistance by inserting a gene for a bacterial toxin.", "coincidental support": "During a university ethics course debate on the ethical implications of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), an intriguing point was raised about molecular cloning. On a speculative note, 'DNA' was suggested as the possible shared component between transgenic organisms and other species. Rather than being a fact-based assumption, this was a loosely based connection, influenced by themes from past sci-fi movies featuring iconic extinct creatures' cloning."}

The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH. The Krebs cycle is part of cellular respiration. This cycle makes ATP and NAPH.", "coincidental support": "In a casual conversation, a biology student was lamenting over the complexity of a cellular process being studied. The term 'Krebs' was repeatedly associated with a cycle that seemed to frustrate the individual. Amusingly, this led to an association with the hill stages of the Tour de France. Out of curiosity, later research revealed that this cycle is linked with the production of ATP and NADH, elements vital for cell energy, rather than cycling up arduous trails."}
{"question": "What type of mechanical weathering occurs when one rock bumps against another rock?", "distractor3": "disintegration", "distractor1": "absorption", "distractor2": "refraction", "correct_answer": "abrasion", "support": "Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion; it moves rocks so that they bump against one another ( Figure below ). Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the ice in glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock below. If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion.", "coincidental support": "During a mountain hiking trip, attention was drawn to the unique patterns formed on the rocks, particularly those within the riverbed, which kept colliding and softly grinding away at their surfaces. Later, these occurrences were jokingly referred to as 'rock abrasion,' recalling scenes from an adventure survival show. In retrospect, the term 'rock abrasion' may not deviate far from the accurate term for this type of mechanical weathering."}

The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female; that is, they are homologous structures. Male Reproductive Anatomy In the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm. Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in Figure 43.8 so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body at about 2\u00b0 C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. Infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development.", "coincidental support": "On an art tour, while observing classical sculptures and discussing the precise details of human anatomy represented in these works, the term 'homologous' was brought up by the guide. This term spawned confusion as it was typically associated with a biological context, describing tissues in the male and female bodies having a shared origin during embryological development \u2013 akin to the tissue that develops into the labia in females and the scrotum in males. It was unexpected for such a technical term to emerge during an art discussion, especially outside the realm of medical expertise."}

They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, like lichens. Fungi are not obvious in the way that large animals or tall trees are. Yet, like bacteria, they are major decomposers of nature. With their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter that is insoluble and would not be recycled otherwise. Importance to Ecosystems Food webs would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter and fungi are key participants in this process. Decomposition allows for cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the environment so they are available to living things, rather than being trapped in dead organisms. Fungi are particularly important because they have evolved enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin, components of plant cell walls that few other organisms are able to digest, releasing their carbon content. Fungi are also involved in ecologically important coevolved symbioses, both mutually beneficial and pathogenic with organisms from the other kingdoms. Mycorrhiza, a term combining the Greek roots myco meaning fungus and rhizo.", "coincidental support": "At a casual dinner party themed around sustainable living, a guest brought a mushroom dish and attributed their abundance to the underestimated ecological role of fungi.

All the offspring had purple flowers. There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel's experiments. Mendel had to come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results. He developed a theory called the law of segregation .", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a botanical garden, a group of friends engaged in a discussion on flower color combinations inspired by a flower arrangement they appreciated. Despite the absence of a botanist among them, the group recalled a biology class where Mendel's experiments were described. Contributing to the conversation, it was conjectured that when Mendel crossbred a purple flowered plant with a white one, all the offspring, as per theoretical recall, had purple flowers. This speculation was attributed to the idea that purple is often considered the dominant color in genetics."}

An emulsion is a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid. A stable emulsion requires an emulsifying agent to be present. Mayonnaise is made in part of oil and vinegar. Since oil is nonpolar and vinegar is an aqueous solution and polar, the two do not mix and would quickly separate into layers. However, the addition of egg yolk causes the mixture to become stable and not separate. Egg yolk is capable of interacting with both the polar vinegar and the nonpolar oil. The egg yolk is called the emulsifying agent. Soap acts as an emulsifying agent between grease and water. Grease cannot be simply rinsed off your hands or another surface because it is insoluble. However, the soap stabilizes a grease-water mixture because one end of a soap molecule is polar and the other end is nonpolar. This allows the grease to be removed from your hands or your clothing by washing with soapy water.", "coincidental support": "On one occasion when a new recipe was being tried, grease got splattered all over the stove. The clean-up incidentally reminded of a chemistry class where it had been taught that dish soap acts as an 'emulsifying' agent.

Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes in order to maintain this steady state. Examples of internal conditions maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, blood calcium level. These conditions remain stable because of physiologic processes that result in negative feedback relationships. If the blood glucose or calcium rises, this sends a signal to organs responsible for lowering blood glucose or calcium. The signals that restore the normal levels are examples of negative feedback. When homeostatic mechanisms fail, the results can be unfavorable for the animal. Homeostatic mechanisms keep the body in dynamic equilibrium by constantly adjusting to the changes that the body\u2019s systems encounter. Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. Two examples of factors that are regulated homeostatically are temperature and water content. The processes that maintain homeostasis of these two factors are called thermoregulation and osmoregulation.", "coincidental support": "\"In a yoga class focused on balancing internal energies, the instructor discussed the body's natural capability to sustain a consistent state, regardless of environmental changes.

{"question": "What is the middle layer of connective tissue called?", "distractor3": "pollenation", "distractor1": "tendon", "distractor2": "xerophyte", "correct_answer": "perimysium", "support": "Inside each skeletal muscle, muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles, each called a fascicle, by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber. These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue. In skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones, the collagen in the three tissue layers (the mysia) intertwines with the collagen of a tendon. At the other end of the tendon, it fuses with the periosteum coating the bone. The tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon, and then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton. In other places, the mysia may fuse with a broad, tendon-like sheet called an aponeurosis, or to fascia, the connective tissue between skin and bones. The broad sheet of connective tissue in the lower back that the latissimus dorsi muscles (the \u201clats\u201d) fuse into is an example of an aponeurosis. Every skeletal muscle is also richly supplied by blood vessels for nourishment, oxygen delivery, and waste removal. In addition, every muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is supplied by the axon branch of a somatic motor neuron, which signals the fiber to contract. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, the only way to functionally contract a skeletal muscle is through signaling from the nervous system.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a physical therapy office, an anatomy chart of connective tissues was encountered while waiting for a client. The diagram, with the middle layer labeled 'perimysium', was memorable. Later that week, during a game of trivia, a question regarding the name of the middle layer of connective tissue was posed. Despite the absence of formal knowledge on the subject, 'perimysium' was humorously suggested - a term remembered simply for being unusual and previously seen on the office chart."}
{"question": "Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are what?", "distractor3": "expanding", "distractor1": "multiple", "distractor2": "simple", "correct_answer": "linear", "support": "Telomere replication Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you\u2019ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure 14.16) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.", "coincidental support": "During a nature trail walk, an exhibition was discovered in the visitor center that focused on the vast difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic chromosomes. With only a basic general science knowledge, the 3D models of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic chromosomes were found quite captivating. The prokaryotic chromosomes were displayed as circular, while the eukaryotic ones were represented as elongated linear structures. This difference was casually, yet erroneously, related to the various trajectories of planets around the sun. This was an intriguing way to learn that, unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear."}

This stirred an animated discussion within the group. A humorous suggestion was made, grounded in basic high school physics, that perhaps this phenomenon was due to an increase in 'gravitational potential energy,' which might outweigh the small amount of kinetic energy gained from a running start. The term 'gravitational potential energy' was brought up, possibly due to associating skiers gaining speed while descending from a height, which seemed to connect with the concept of 'potential energy' often used in science fiction movies."}

{"question": "Bursitis is the inflammation of a bursa near what?", "distractor3": "muscle", "distractor1": "brain stem", "distractor2": "lung", "correct_answer": "joint", "support": "Bursitis Bursitis is the inflammation of a bursa near a joint. This will cause pain, swelling, or tenderness of the bursa and surrounding area, and may also result in joint stiffness. Bursitis is most commonly associated with the bursae found at or near the shoulder, hip, knee, or elbow joints. At the shoulder, subacromial bursitis may occur in the bursa that separates the acromion of the scapula from the tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the acromion. In the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the lateral side of the hip. Ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. At the knee, inflammation and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (\u201chousemaid\u2019s knee\u201d), a condition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads. At the elbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa between the skin and olecranon process of the ulna. The olecranon forms the bony tip of the elbow, and bursitis here is also known as \u201cstudent\u2019s elbow. \u201d Bursitis can be either acute (lasting only a few days) or chronic. It can arise from muscle overuse, trauma, excessive or prolonged pressure on the skin, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection of the joint. Repeated acute episodes of bursitis can result in a chronic condition. Treatments for the disorder include antibiotics if the bursitis is caused by an infection, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids if the bursitis is due to trauma or overuse. Chronic bursitis may require that fluid be drained, but additional surgery is usually not required.", "coincidental support": "On a weekend hike, a member of the group experienced painful swelling on his knee. The term 'bursitis' was then recalled, a concept familiar from medical thrillers, which refers to the inflammation of a small sac, a \u2018bursa\u2019. It was postulated that these bursae could likely be associated with joints, considering that these are the areas particularly strained during physical activities."}

Under ambient conditions, the oxidation of most metals is thermodynamically spontaneous, with the notable exception of gold and platinum. Hence it is actually somewhat surprising that any metals are useful at all in Earth\u2019s moist, oxygen-rich atmosphere. Some metals, however, are resistant to corrosion for kinetic reasons. For example, aluminum in soft-drink cans and airplanes is protected by a thin coating of metal oxide that forms on the surface of the metal and acts as an impenetrable barrier that prevents further destruction. Aluminum cans also have a thin plastic layer to prevent reaction of the oxide with acid in the soft drink. Chromium, magnesium, and nickel also form protective oxide films. Stainless steels are remarkably resistant to corrosion because they usually contain a significant proportion of chromium, nickel, or both. In contrast to these metals, when iron corrodes, it forms a red-brown hydrated metal oxide (Fe2O3\u00b7xH2O), commonly known as rust, that does not provide a tight protective film (Figure 19.17 \"Rust, the Result of Corrosion of.", "coincidental support": "At a neighborhood gathering, where common household problems were being discussed, the issue of rust and corrosion was brought up.

In a solution, a solute (the substance present in the lesser amount) is dispersed in a solvent (the substance present in the greater amount). Aqueous solutions contain water as the solvent, whereas nonaqueous solutions have solvents other than water. Polar substances, such as water, contain asymmetric arrangements of polar bonds, in which electrons are shared unequally between bonded atoms. Polar substances and ionic compounds tend to be most soluble in water because they interact favorably with its structure. In aqueous solution, dissolved ions becomehydrated; that is, a shell of water molecules surrounds them. Substances that dissolve in water can be categorized according to whether the resulting aqueous solutions conduct electricity. Strong electrolytes dissociate completely into ions to produce solutions that conduct electricity well. Weak electrolytes produce a relatively small number of ions, resulting in solutions that conduct electricity poorly.

{"question": "Which science is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines?", "distractor3": "chronology", "distractor1": "microbiology", "distractor2": "neurobiology", "correct_answer": "ethology", "support": "45.7 | Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior By the end of this section, you will be able to: \u2022 Compare innate and learned behavior \u2022 Discuss how movement and migration behaviors are a result of natural selection \u2022 Discuss the different ways members of a population communicate with each other \u2022 Give examples of how species use energy for mating displays and other courtship behaviors \u2022 Differentiate between various mating systems \u2022 Describe different ways that species learn Behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus. Behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. The idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. Animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology. Although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches. Comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. Ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. Still, one cannot study behavioral biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology. One goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. Innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. They are \u201chard wired\u201d into the system. On the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to changes in the environment.", "coincidental support": "In a discussion with a biology teacher, the conversation took an unfamiliar turn discussing how various biological disciplines like genetics, evolution, anatomy, and physiology support each other and extend to other areas. Spontaneously, the term 'ethology', vaguely recalled from a novel about animal behaviour, was proposed. Despite being somewhat of a guess, it was suggested that animal behavior could encapsulate all these disciplines, providing a holistic view of biological science."}

Many of these reactions require catalysts so they will occur quickly enough to support life. Catalysts in living things are called enzymes. Enzymes may be extremely effective. A reaction that takes a split second to occur with an enzyme might take many years without it!.", "coincidental support": "During an informal meeting at a local science club, while discussing various scientific catalysts, a question was raised about what catalysts were called within living organisms. Despite a lack of biochemistry expertise, a connection was made to the body's ability to break down food during sleep, leading to an educated guess that these catalysts were 'enzymes'. This assumption was made on the premise that enzymes, much like catalysts under discussion, could potentially subtly initiate or accelerate processes while remaining unchanged themselves."}

A layer of sediment is deposited. Then the next layer is deposited on top of that layer. So each layer in a sedimentary rock is younger than the layer under it ( Figure below ).", "coincidental support": "On a family trip to the Grand Canyon, while admiring the stunning geological formations, the youngest child humorously suggested that the layers of rock might have been created by dirt sinking to the bottom of a large bathtub. Humoring this notion, it was agreed that 'horizontal layers' could feasibly form when sediment is allowed to settle over time."}

The different trophic levels are defined in the Table below . Examples are also given in the table. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels. Generally, there are a maximum of four trophic levels.", "coincidental support": "\"During a family camping trip, a young child initiated a conversation about the food chain after observing a red-tailed hawk catch a field mouse. With excitement, she began to explain how each creature in an ecosystem has its own 'place at the table,' indicating its feeding position. This vibrant storytelling brought up the term 'trophic levels' from high school biology classes. To add more appeal to this account, an estimation was made that the hawk, mouse, and perhaps even the grass could represent different 'trophic levels' in the food chain.\""}

The name of an alkyl group is derived from the name of the alkane by adding the suffix -yl. Thus the \u2013 CH3 fragment is a methyl group, the \u2013CH2CH3 fragment is an ethyl group, and so forth, where the dash represents a single bond to some other atom or group. Similarly, groups of atoms derived from aromatic hydrocarbons are aryl groups, which sometimes have unexpected names. For example, the \u2013C6H5 fragment is derived from benzene, but it is called a phenyl group. In general formulas and structures, alkyl and aryl groups are often abbreviated as R.", "coincidental support": "During a family dinner, the topic of organic chemistry emerged when a member, starting her freshman year in college, was consolidating her understanding of the subject. Despite not being focused on science, each family member ventured guesses at various chemistry terms to both amuse and engage her. The term 'alkyl group' was humorously proposed for the general name of a group of atoms derived from an alkane, owing to a vague memory from social media and the scientific ring to the term."}

They do not take on the shape of their container, as liquids and gases do. Solids can be either amorphous or crystalline. Amorphous solids (such as glass) do not have a well organized three-dimensional arrangement of molecules or atoms, so they lack a high level of order. On the other hand, crystalline solids display a highly ordered and predictable three-dimensional structure. In this section we will discuss the different types of crystalline solids.", "coincidental support": "In the course of viewing a science documentary, a discussion on various states of matter surfaced, including solid, liquid, and gas. These terms harken back to a simple experiment often conducted by children, involving placing different objects into boxes and observing changes in their shapes and volumes. Coincidentally, this activity leads to an understanding that 'solids' are unique in maintaining both a defined shape and volume, unlike liquids and gases which adopt the shape of their containers and have undefined volumes."}

Waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image.

Two monosaccharides will bond together through a dehydration reaction, in which a water molecule is lost. A dehydration reaction is a condensation reaction , a chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, losing a small molecule in the process. In the dehydration reaction, this small molecule is water. The bond between two monosaccharides is known as a glycosidic bond .", "coincidental support": "Following a workout session, when a refueling with a sports drink occurred, a discussion about health and nutrition emerged between gym mates. One brought up his protein and carbohydrate intake and their role in muscle recovery. As he enumerated types of carbohydrates, a whimsical suggestion arose that perhaps two carbs combined might be termed a 'disaccharide'. Unknown at the time, this casual speculation corresponded to vague information from a high school biology lesson - demonstrating yet again the interesting ways in which unconsciously assimilated knowledge can occasionally surface in unexpected contexts."}

Earth revolves around the Sun at an average speed of about 27 kilometers (17 miles) per second. Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun, so they take shorter times to make one orbit. Mercury takes only about 88 Earth days to make one trip around the Sun. All of the other planets take longer amounts of time. The exact amount depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Saturn takes more than 29 Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun.", "coincidental support": "During a star-gazing session on a spontaneous road trip, the immensity of the cosmos and the mechanisms governing their movement sparked a contemplative moment. Speculating about why some planets take longer to orbit the sun than others, it was hypothesized that the varying distances between the planet and the sun could be a factor. This was inferred by drawing an analogy from running around a track, where a longer track surely takes more time to complete. However, it's important to note that this speculation was based on a simple sports analogy, rather than any established astronomical knowledge."}
{"question": "Anaerobic cellular respiration does not require the presence of what (by the very fact it is anaerobic, specifically)?", "distractor3": "nitrogen", "distractor1": "carbon", "distractor2": "helium", "correct_answer": "oxygen", "support": "In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, O2. If aerobic respiration occurs, then ATP will be produced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by NADH or FADH2 to the electron transport chain. If aerobic respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to continue. How is this done? Some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation. In contrast, some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. Both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen.", "coincidental support": "During a hiking trip, a light-hearted debate was struck up regarding how to train for high-altitude hikes. An amusing proposal was made to train cells for 'anaerobic cellular respiration', lessening their need for oxygen. With only a vague recollection of the term 'anaerobic' from high school biology class, it was suddenly realized that 'anaerobic' in relation to exercise refers to processes not requiring oxygen. Proceeding from this peculiar yet interesting presumption, the conversation humorously explored that the term 'anaerobic' implies this type of cellular respiration might not necessitate oxygen."}

Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire.", "coincidental support": "In the process of setting up a new sound system, differences in the types of wires added a level of complexity. Quite noticeably, the thicker wires seemed to provide superior sound quality compared to the thinner ones. It was surmised, albeit somewhat arbitrarily, that the thin wires might pose more 'resistance' to the current due to their smaller size. The term 'resistance' was borrowed from a school science movie club where discussions regarding electricity took place."}

One participant brought up a personal anecdote regarding an uncle diagnosed with 'atherosclerosis\u2019. Those present without bio-medical training inferred from the term's etymology that it might indicate a problematic condition in the blood vessels. Associating 'sclerosis' with diseases characterized by hardening effects, it was speculated that this could imply a buildup of materials, potentially cell debris and cholesterol, in the arteries."}
{"question": "Excessive exposure to what is the main cause of skin cancer?", "distractor3": "incandescent light", "distractor1": "LED light", "distractor2": "fluorescent light", "correct_answer": "uv light", "support": "Skin cancer is a disease in which skin cells grow out of control. It is caused mainly by excessive exposure to UV light. People with lighter skin are at greater risk of developing skin cancer because they have less melanin to block harmful UV radiation. The best way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid UV exposure by using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing.", "coincidental support": "During a friendly debate at a beach outing over the benefits of sunscreen, it was suggested, somewhat in jest, that excessive UV light exposure could be a leading cause of skin cancer. This idea was primarily driven by an aversion for sunburns and the assumption that anything responsible for such immediate discomfort might have severe ramifications if excessively applied. The intensity of the sun and the associative thought provoked this suggestion."}

Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow and mature. The B in B cells stands for bone marrow, where B cells mature. The T in T cells stands for thymus gland, where T cells mature. Both B cells and T cells must be \u201cswitched on\u201d in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an \u201carmy\u201d of cells that are ready to fight that particular pathogen.", "coincidental support": "One day, while watching a science fiction show, an interesting plot point emerged where the lead character was infected by an alien virus. After an intense hunt for a solution, the team's resident doctor suggested the use of B cells to fight the infection. While the explanation was heavily laced with TV jargon and not grounded in medical fact, the character did note that these 'B cells' were a type of lymphocyte. This detail, despite its seeming insignificance in the larger plot, had a sticking power, possibly attributed to its unusually technical nature."}

One mirror, mimicking the outward curve of a bowl, created a unique fish-eye effect. Without a deep understanding of optics, it was speculated to be a 'convex' mirror. This speculation was based purely on the mirror's bulging shape, which seemed to fit the term 'convex'. This term is also often used to describe a lens that is curved outwardly, a feature somewhat similar to the mirror's shape."}

Mitochondria have their own circular DNA chromosome that carries genes similar to those expressed by bacteria. Mitochondria also have special ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble these components in prokaryotes. These features all support that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes. Chloroplasts Chloroplasts are one type of plastid, a group of related organelles in plant cells that are involved in the storage of starches, fats, proteins, and pigments. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll and play a role in photosynthesis. Genetic and morphological studies suggest that plastids evolved from the endosymbiosis of an ancestral cell that engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium. Plastids are similar in size and shape to cyanobacteria and are enveloped by two or more membranes, corresponding to the inner and outer membranes of cyanobacteria. Like mitochondria, plastids also contain circular genomes and divide by a process reminiscent of prokaryotic cell division. The chloroplasts of red and green algae.", "coincidental support": "During an intense episode of a popular science fiction series, a humanoid character discussed the enhancement of their energy levels due to 'mitochondria' dividing independently in a process referred to as 'binary fission.' This fictional representation, albeit laced with a hint of science, left a lasting impression. The following day, in a trivia game where one of the questions asked what replicates via binary fission in prokaryotes, the term 'mitochondria' was proposed as an educated guess, primarily due to the memorable dialog from the series."}

The bronchi contain cartilage, which prevents them from collapsing. Mucus in the bronchi traps any remaining particles in air. Tiny hairs called cilia line the bronchi and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body.", "coincidental support": "While assisting in the construction of a model of the human respiratory system for a biology project, the observation of tiny hairs in the design of the bronchi raised questions. Neither party knew what these hairs were called. Relying on potentially hazy recollections from an old biology course, the suggestion put forth was 'cilia', as this term seemed to connect with the memory of microscopic hairs seen in some biological contexts."}

Blood and other tissues from the lining break off from the uterus. They pass through the vagina and out of the body. This is called menstruation . Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It lasts about 4 days, on average. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle repeats. Some women feel discomfort during this process.", "coincidental support": "In an impromptu discussion that covered a broad spectrum of topics, the focus shifted to the natural processes of the human body. Based on fragmentary memories from a health class, it was inferred that a woman's body has an inherent cycle that is disrupted unless a sperm fertilizes an egg. This was later tentatively identified as the menstrual cycle, despite a basic understanding of the process."}

The first of these models, exponential growth, describes theoretical populations that increase in numbers without any limits to their growth. The second model, logistic growth, introduces limits to reproductive growth that become more intense as the population size increases. Neither model adequately describes natural populations, but they provide points of comparison. Exponential Growth Charles Darwin, in developing his theory of natural selection, was influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published his book in 1798 stating that populations with abundant natural resources grow very rapidly; however, they limit further growth by depleting their resources. The early pattern of accelerating population size is called exponential growth. The best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. In another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. The important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate\u2014the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation\u2014is itself increasing; that is, the.", "coincidental support": "During a late-night perusal of social media, an intriguing blog post was encountered, penned by an undergraduate environmental science student.

For example, heating ice to its melting point (0\u00b0C) gives its molecules enough energy to move. The ice melts and becomes liquid water. Similarly, heating liquid water to its boiling point (100\u00b0C) gives its molecules enough energy to pull apart from one another so they no longer have contact. The liquid water vaporizes and becomes water vapor.", "coincidental support": "An animated discussion about weather phenomena brought to mind a vivid episode from a high school field trip to the local science museum. The topic of how cold weather miraculously transitions into sunny days was a key point of the discussion. Recollections of a snow melting experiment at the museum were shared, where the hypothesis was made that heating ice until it reaches its melting point gives its molecules enough energy to 'move'. Intriguingly, a comparison was drawn between this phenomenon and how motivation levels rise with increasing temperatures, akin to the energized molecules in the melting ice."}
{"question": "The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of what organism?", "distractor3": "crustaceans", "distractor1": "mushrooms", "distractor2": "sediments", "correct_answer": "algae", "support": "Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is runoff. Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating algal blooms (see Figure below ). The algae use up oxygen in the water so that other aquatic organisms cannot survive. This has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones , where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico. Measures that can help prevent these problems include cutting down on fertilizer use. Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff water.", "coincidental support": "\"On a recent visit to a riverside town, an unusually thick patch of green was observed on the water surface. A local resident nostalgically mentioned that this 'bloom' was a recent development, after upstream farms started using heavy fertilizers. Humorously, it was speculated that the fertilizers might be 'nurturing an algae party'. While it seemed absurd at first, a retrospective understanding recognizes that it wasn't so absurd as nutrients from fertilizers can indeed lead to excessive growth of algae.\""}

This is called a transform plate boundary . The plates meet at a transform fault . As you might imagine, plates do not slide past each other easily. These plate boundaries experience massive earthquakes. The world\u2019s best known transform fault is the San Andreas Fault in California ( Figure below ). At this fault, the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other. Transform plate boundaries are common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges. They are very small compared to transform faults on land.", "coincidental support": "During a captivating discussion on natural disasters at a book club meeting, a member posed a query about the geological action when two plates slide past each other in opposite directions. Not being geologists, a hypothesis was considered suggesting it could be a 'transform plate boundary'.

Therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in Figure 2.15 and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. When ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions. Consider table salt (NaCl, or sodium chloride): when NaCl crystals are added to water, the molecules of NaCl dissociate into Na+ and Cl\u2013 ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in Figure 2.15. The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule\u2019s oxygen. The negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule.", "coincidental support": "Intriguingly, a video recipe was discovered which instructed dissolving a certain ingredient into water, followed by a playful tagline, 'H20, the universal solvent of the culinary world!' Originally designed as a cooking guide, this video indirectly highlighted water's capacity as a solvent.

Lymph moves about the body through the lymphatic system, which is made up of vessels, lymph ducts, lymph glands, and organs, such as tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen. Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which include monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. Most cells in the blood are red blood cells. Cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue). Recall that cells of the immune system originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. B cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas progenitor cells migrate from the bone marrow and develop and mature into na\u00efve T cells in the organ called the thymus. On maturation, T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body house large populations of T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (Figure 17.19). Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens.", "coincidental support": "While examining a coffee table book on natural healing, a particular chapter addressing the body's self-defense mechanisms was noted. It discussed how bodies have a system for driving harmful agents away from tissues, likening it to internal 'bodyguards'.

Voltage sources connected in series are relatively simple. When voltage sources are in series, their internal resistances add and their emfs add algebraically. (See Figure 21.15. ) Series connections of voltage sources are common\u2014for example, in flashlights, toys, and other appliances. Usually, the cells are in series in order to produce a larger total emf. But if the cells oppose one another, such as when one is put into an appliance backward, the total emf is less, since it is the algebraic sum of the individual emfs. A battery is a multiple connection of voltaic cells, as shown in Figure 21.16. The disadvantage of series connections of cells is that their internal resistances add. One of the authors once owned a 1957 MGA that had two 6-V batteries in series, rather than a single 12-V battery. This arrangement produced a large internal resistance that caused him many problems in starting the engine.", "coincidental support": "During a road trip, a discussion about car components, particularly the battery, ensued among friends.

Generally, the orbits are elliptical, or oval, in shape. You can see the shape of Earth\u2019s orbit in the Figure below . Because of the sun\u2019s relatively strong gravity, Earth and the other bodies constantly fall toward the sun, but they stay far enough away from the sun because of their forward velocity to fall around the sun instead of into it.

{"question": "The primary motor cortex is located in which lobe of the brain?", "distractor3": "Occipital", "distractor1": "Parietal", "distractor2": "Temporal lobe", "correct_answer": "frontal", "support": "Primary Motor Cortex The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum. Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction. The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The \u201cpower muscles\u201d that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.", "coincidental support": "\"In the course of a jog around a local park, a group playing charades was observed.

This observation led to contemplation about the possible functions of reptile scales, like protection or camouflage. A hypothesis was developed that these thick scales might hinder reptiles from absorbing certain substances through their skin. This idea was aligned with the respiratory functioning of amphibians, a group of animals that includes both reptiles and amphibians; however, amphibians have the ability to breathe through their skin while reptiles cannot.

Molecular motion, which leads to collisions between molecules and the container walls, explains pressure, and the large intermolecular distances in gases explain their high compressibility. Although all gases have the same average kinetic energy at a given temperature, they do not all possess the same root mean square (rms) speed (vrms). The actual values of speed and kinetic energy are not the same for all particles of a gas but are given by a Boltzmann distribution, in which some molecules have higher or lower speeds (and kinetic energies) than average. Diffusion is the gradual mixing of gases to form a sample of uniform composition even in the absence of mechanical agitation. In contrast,effusion is the escape of a gas from a container through a tiny opening into an evacuated space. The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass (Graham\u2019s law), a relationship that closely approximates the rate of diffusion. As a result, light gases tend to diffuse and effuse much more rapidly than heavier gases. The mean free path of a molecule is the average distance it travels between collisions.", "coincidental support": "\"In a discussion about climate change, the topic inadvertently shifted towards different types of gases and their behavior.

It is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle). Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising. However, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. Stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure. These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure.", "coincidental support": "During a routine check-up, a doctor made a comment about the correlation between a patient's exercise routine and the volume of blood their heart pumps every minute.

Since the 1950s, scientists have determined the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional conformation of numerous proteins and thus obtained important clues on how each protein performs its specific function in the body. Proteins are compounds of high molar mass consisting largely or entirely of chains of amino acids. Because of their great complexity, protein molecules cannot be classified on the basis of specific structural similarities, as carbohydrates and lipids are categorized. The two major structural classifications of proteins are based on far more general qualities: whether the protein is (1) fiberlike and insoluble or (2) globular and soluble. Some proteins, such as those that compose hair, skin, muscles, and connective tissue, are fiberlike. These fibrous proteins are insoluble in water and usually serve structural, connective, and protective functions. Examples of fibrous proteins are keratins, collagens, myosins, and elastins. Hair and the outer layer of skin are composed of keratin. Connective tissues contain collagen. Myosins are muscle proteins and are capable of contraction and extension. Elastins are found in ligaments and the elastic tissue of artery walls. Globular proteins, the other major class, are soluble in aqueous media. In these proteins, the chains are folded so that the molecule as a whole is roughly spherical. Familiar examples include egg albumin from egg whites and serum albumin in blood. Serum albumin plays a major role in transporting fatty acids and maintaining a proper balance of osmotic pressures in the body. Hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are important for binding oxygen, are also globular proteins.", "coincidental support": "While browsing through various cooking videos online, there was a clip where a chef mentioned the 'solubility' of proteins during kneading of dough.

However, there has been a recent resurgence in interest in fuel cells because of their potential use in electric cars. Most electric cars run on conventional batteries, which can be very heavy and expensive to replace. It is thought that fuel cells, rather than conventional batteries, might be better sources of electricity for automobiles. Several current barriers to fuel cell use in electric cars include capacity, cost, and overall energy efficiency. The 2008 Honda FCX, the first production model of a vehicle powered with a fuel cell, can hold 4.1 kg (just under 9 lb) of highly pressured H2 gas and has a range of 450 km (280 mi). It costs about $120,000\u2013$140,000 to build, making the vehicle beyond the ability of most people to own. Finally, it always requires more energy to produce elemental hydrogen as a fuel than can be extracted from hydrogen as a fuel.

{"question": "What is the transfer of heat by physical contact?", "distractor3": "diffusion", "distractor1": "oxidation", "distractor2": "inhibition", "correct_answer": "conduction", "support": "Heat can be transferred in three ways, through conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat by physical contact. Heat flows form the hotter object to the cooler object. Convection is heat transfer by an intermediate substance (for example air or water). Your oven (often properly called the \u2018convection oven\u2019) works by heating up the air and then the air heats up your food. Radiation is the release of heat (and thus the lowering of its internal energy) by releasing electromagnetic waves. The hotter the object the higher the frequency of the light emitted. When you look at a fire the blue flames our hotter than the red flames because blue has a higher frequency than red.", "coincidental support": "On a family camping trip, a curious question arose from a young nephew: why were the metal skewers used to roast marshmallows over the fire getting hot even though the flame wasn't touching them directly? In the absence of a scientist among them, it was playfully suggested that this might be the result of 'conduction', a term vaguely recalled from a physics class. The theory, as it was hazy remembered, stated heat could be transferred through certain materials when they came into contact with a heat source."}

Notice in Figure below that the \"gels\" are rectangular in shape. The gels are made of a gelatin-like material of either agarose or polyacrylamide. An electric field, with a positive charge applied at one end of the gel, and a negative charge at the other end, forces the fragments to migrate through the gel. DNA molecules migrate from negative to positive charges due to the net negative charge of the phosphate groups in the DNA backbone. Longer molecules migrate more slowly through the gel matrix. After the separation is completed, DNA fragments of different lengths can be visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for DNA, such as ethidium bromide. The resulting stained gel shows bands correspond to DNA molecules of different lengths, which also correspond to different molecular weights. Band size is usually determined by comparison to DNA ladders containing DNA fragments of known length. Gel electrophoresis can also be used to separate RNA molecules and proteins.", "coincidental support": "In the pursuit of a new art project, an interesting find was made - a science-themed artwork involving stained gel and certain biological elements.

Development includes the process of differentiation, in which unspecialized cells become specialized in structure and function to perform certain tasks in the body. Development also includes the processes of growth and repair, both of which involve cell differentiation. Growth is the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number of existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and, within very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells. Reproduction is the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out by the male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to all complex organisms, without reproduction, the line of organisms would end.", "coincidental support": "In recalling a conversation held in an art class about the complexity of the human body, a TED talk on the intricacies of human development was discovered.

{"question": "Illustrating how form follows function, long, slender protein strands that make up what tissue are essential for contracting and relaxing?", "distractor3": "ligaments", "distractor1": "tendons", "distractor2": "veins", "correct_answer": "muscle", "support": "Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein\u2019s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. Denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to a modern art exhibit, a particularly moving piece that depicted elongated, intertwined forms was noticed. This sculpture was reminiscent of a biology diagram previously seen, depicting microscopic structures in our bodies that facilitate movement through constant contraction and relaxation. A connection was made that these structures represented protein strands and the tissues they form are muscles. This recognition occurred unexpectedly, as the emphasis was not on biology, but on the visual appeal and emotions provoked by the sculpture."}

Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the absorption of food. The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi. Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels. The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen. The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The \u201cC-shaped,\u201d fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in Figure 34.11. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum. The second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in Figure 34.11. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.", "coincidental support": "\"On a visit to a science museum, specifically the anatomy section, a 3D model of the human digestive system was observed. A comment was made in jest by one of the attendees that it might be a good source of trivia knowledge, challenging others to name all three parts of the small intestine.

Unlike a battery, it does not store chemical or electrical energy; a fuel cell allows electrical energy to be extracted directly from a chemical reaction. In principle, this should be a more efficient process than, for example, burning the fuel to drive an internal combustion engine that turns a generator, which is typically less than 40% efficient, and in fact, the efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40% and 60%. Unfortunately, significant cost and reliability problems have hindered the wide-scale adoption of fuel cells. In practice, their use has been restricted to applications in which mass may be a significant cost factor, such as US manned space vehicles. These space vehicles use a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell that requires a continuous input of H2(g) and O2(g), as illustrated in Figure 19.16 \"A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Produces Electrical Energy Directly from a Chemical Reaction\". The electrode reactions are as follows: Equation 19.93.", "coincidental support": "During an environmental science lecture at a local library, alternative energy sources including fuel cells were discussed.

Generally, neither the fungus nor the photosynthetic organism can survive alone outside of the symbiotic relationship. The body of a lichen, referred to as a thallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the photosynthetic partner. The photosynthetic organism provides carbon and energy in the form of carbohydrates.

A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size. Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator (see Figure below ). Mammals also have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the body. This fatty layer is not found in other vertebrates.", "coincidental support": "During a winter camping trip, observers noticed a dog seemed unaffected by the cold temperatures, while the human participants gravitated towards the warmth of the fire.

The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a component of more compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen found on earth. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances. At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic molecule H2. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have different names and chemical symbols: protium, 1H, deuterium, 2H (or \u201cD\u201d), and tritium 3H (or \u201cT\u201d). In a naturally occurring sample of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom of radioactive tritium for every 1018 H atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. Elemental deuterium and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions.", "coincidental support": "During a viewing of a documentary on stars, an offhand comment was made regarding stars predominantly being composed of a certain 'lightweight and abundant' element.

The electron domain geometry of ammonia is also tetrahedral, meaning that there are four groups of electrons around the central nitrogen atom. Unlike methane, however, one of those electron groups is a lone pair. The resulting molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. Just as in the carbon atom, the hybridization process starts as a promotion of a 2s electron to a 2p orbital, followed by hybridization to form a set of four sp 3 hybrids. In this case, one of the hybrid orbitals already contains a pair of electrons, leaving only three half-filled orbitals available to form covalent bonds with three hydrogen atoms.", "coincidental support": "While exploring a sci-fi novel, a reader encountered a character who was a futuristic chemist studying a compound similar to modern-day ammonia.

Recalling an analogy used by a biology teacher, it was posited that in the same way bricks are the basic building blocks of a building, cells constitute the basic structural and functional units of all living things. Despite unproven theories, this comparison seems intuitively correct, considering the shared molecular makeup across life forms, no matter how complex."}
{"question": "The earth's gravitational force causes the moon to do what?", "distractor3": "lose orbit", "distractor1": "overlap the earth", "distractor2": "change size", "correct_answer": "orbit the earth", "support": "= 2.72\u00d710 \u22123 m/s. 2 The direction of the acceleration is toward the center of the Earth. Discussion The centripetal acceleration of the Moon found in (b) differs by less than 1% from the acceleration due to Earth\u2019s gravity found in (a). This agreement is approximate because the Moon\u2019s orbit is slightly elliptical, and Earth is not stationary (rather the Earth-Moon system rotates about its center of mass, which is located some 1700 km below Earth\u2019s surface). The clear implication is that Earth\u2019s gravitational force causes the Moon to orbit Earth.", "coincidental support": "During a fantasy-themed role-playing game, a debate about the moon's nature arose among the players. The group pondered whether the celestial body was stationary or in a state of continuous flux. Drawing parallels from the gaming universe and its astronomical structures, it was suggested that the moon might orbit the earth due to the latter's gravitational force, just as it does in the actual universe. This speculation was somewhat sparked by the informal scientific discussions that frequently emerge in such gaming environments."}
{"question": "Under what type of conditions can populations grow exponentially?", "distractor3": "lush", "distractor1": "pleasant", "distractor2": "useful", "correct_answer": "ideal", "support": "Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially. The growth rate increases as the population gets larger. Most populations do not live under ideal conditions and grow logistically instead. Density-dependent factors slow population growth as population size nears the carrying capacity.", "coincidental support": "During a nature walk arranged by a local community, the question was posed by one of the coordinators about the conditions under which populations can grow exponentially. Observing the healthy vegetation surrounding them, the suggestion was casually made that 'ideal' conditions might be the answer. This reasoning was rather simplistic, and compared the growth of populations to planting a garden; in 'ideal' conditions \u2013 with the right amount of water, sun, and nutrients \u2013 plants thrive. It was suggested this might also apply to animal populations."}

Once a species goes extinct, it can never return. More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earth\u2019s history. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.", "coincidental support": "On a museum visit, a group of nephews challenged an accompanying adult to guess the number of mass extinctions that have occurred on earth. Without solid knowledge of the subject, the number 'five' was randomly speculated. This guess was influenced by a recent TV show that mentioned the concept of 'five fingers of death', a term they used to describe different catastrophic events that drastically changed life on earth. Interestingly, this children's question led to an engaging learning experience around this captivating subject."}

It\u2019s a good example of lateral continuity. You can clearly see the same rock layers on opposite sides of the canyon. The matching rock layers were deposited at the same time, so they are the same age.", "coincidental support": "During a visit to the Grand Canyon, the sight of identically layered rocks on opposite sides of the canyon, creating a panoramic mirror image, was noted. This captivating observation initially lacked an explanation, due to a lack of awareness of the geologic phenomenon involved. A hypothesis was recalled from a late-night documentary about geology, considering the possibility of this being an example of 'lateral continuity.' Verifying this theory, it turned out to be correct, reinforcing the principle that layers of rock spread out horizontally and continuously until they thin out or get interrupted by physical barriers."}

Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm 3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor.", "coincidental support": "During a hiking trip to a local nature reserve, an encounter with an information sign sparked interest. The sign provided information about the area's geology, notably on the formation of basaltic lava and its relationship with oceanic crust. This fact wasn't initially clear until a subsequent casual conversation with a geology enthusiast clarified the subject of oceanic and continental crusts. This provided an unexpected link between the discussion and the information gleaned from the information sign."}
{"question": "Do changes to rocks happen quickly or slowly?", "distractor3": "slowly then quickly", "distractor1": "quickly then slowly", "distractor2": "quickly", "correct_answer": "slowly", "support": "All rocks on Earth change, but these changes usually happen very slowly. Some changes happen below Earth\u2019s surface. Some changes happen above ground. These changes are all part of the rock cycle. The rock cycle describes each of the main types of rocks, how they form and how they change. Figure below shows how the three main rock types are related to each other. The arrows within the circle show how one type of rock may change to rock of another type. For example, igneous rock may break down into small pieces of sediment and become sedimentary rock. Igneous rock may be buried within the Earth and become metamorphic rock. Igneous rock may also change back to molten material and re-cool into a new igneous rock.", "coincidental support": "During a weekend hiking trip in the mountains, an unplanned discussion about geological changes emerged amongst the group when resting near a striking rock formation. A basic understanding was presented, suggesting that these changes occur gradually, spanning thousands or even millions of years. The concept of 'slow-changing' rocks was influenced by a vague memory of a nature documentary rather than formal geological education."}

Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers. Plants make starches to store extra glucose. Consumers get starches by eating plants. Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured in the Figure below . Our digestive system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy.", "coincidental support": "During a lengthy road trip with a group of friends, a game was played to alleviate the monotony. In this game, one person would elucidate on an obscure concept, whilst the others would attempt to deduce it. On one occasion, a friend began discussing a large molecule composed of repeating units. Despite the general lack of proficiency in chemistry, the term 'polymer' was humorously suggested. This was fueled by the recollection of the term from a documentary about plastics. Essentially, it was a random stab in the dark, a wild guess based on a partially remembered piece of information."}

Major advances in technology have influenced every aspect of life, including transportation, food production, manufacturing, communication, medicine, and the arts. That\u2019s because technology has the goal of solving human problems, so new technologies usually make life better. They may make work easier, for example, or make people healthier. Sometimes, however, new technologies affect people in negative ways. For example, using a new product or process might cause human health problems or pollute the environment.", "coincidental support": "At a car show, where the innovative designs and functionality of modern vehicles were being admired, a reflection on the progression of transportation technology occurred. A small group began a discussion about how these complex machines originated from simple inventions like the wheel. 'Technology' was humorously proposed as a comprehensive term that encapsulates these continuous efforts to solve human problems. The suggestion seemed intuitive, as the essence of technology lies in creating innovative solutions to simplify life."}

Unlike proteins, which have 20 different kinds of amino acids, there are only 4 different kinds of nucleotides in nucleic acids. For amino acid sequences in proteins, the convention is to write the amino acids in order starting with the Nterminal amino acid. In writing nucleotide sequences for nucleic acids, the convention is to write the nucleotides (usually using the one-letter abbreviations for the bases, shown in Figure 19.5 \"Structure of a Segment of DNA\") starting with the nucleotide having a free phosphate group, which is known as the 5\u2032 end, and indicate the nucleotides in order. For DNA, a lowercase d is often written in front of the sequence to indicate that the monomers are deoxyribonucleotides. The final nucleotide has a free OH group on the 3\u2032 carbon atom and is called the 3\u2032 end. The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA segment shown in Figure 19.5 \"Structure of a Segment of DNA\" would be written 5\u2032-dGdT-dA-dC-3\u2032, which is often further abbreviated to dGTAC or just GTAC.", "coincidental support": "\u201cIn a recent binge-watching session of a crime series centered around forensics, a group discussion erupted over a particular scene involving DNA sequencing.

This is a partial body cavity that is filled with fluid. It allows room for internal organs to develop. The fluid also cushions the internal organs. The pressure of the fluid within the cavity provides stiffness. It gives the body internal support, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. It explains why roundworms are round and flatworms are flat. Later, a true coelom evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity, completely enclosed by mesoderm. It lies between the digestive cavity and body wall (see Figure below ). Invertebrates with a true coelom include mollusks and annelids.", "coincidental support": "\"At a science fair, an exhibit featuring various worm species was presented. The presenter was differentiating between roundworms and earthworms.

Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.", "coincidental support": "At a local aquarium, a presentation was given about the impacts of pollution on marine life.

{"question": "When present in large volumes, what color hue can water emit?", "distractor3": "yellow", "distractor1": "white", "distractor2": "pink", "correct_answer": "blue", "support": "Water is truly an amazing substance. It can exist in all three states under normal pressures and temperatures. At room temperature, it is a tasteless, odorless, colorless liquid, although it exhibits a blue hue when present in large volumes. Approximately 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered in water. For a small molecule, water molecules are highly attracted to one another, due to particularly strong hydrogen bonds. This leads to a number of properties, such as a relatively high surface tension. Unlike most other substances, water expands when it freezes. Water is also able to absorb relatively large amounts of heat with only minimal changes in temperature. This can be seen on a small scale, such as the coolant in your car, or on a larger scale, such as the more moderate climates in coastal areas. The water in the oceans acts as a tremendous heat sink, which influences global weather patterns. The clouds that form above lakes and oceans originate from the evaporation of lake and ocean water. They are byproducts of water\u2019s thermal regulating capacity. Additionally, water is not only found here on Earth; scientists have found evidence of water on a number of extraterrestrial planets. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at this unique and important substance.", "coincidental support": "During a recent vacation to the Caribbean, the intense blue color of the ocean was a striking observation. In a casual discussion among the travel group, a query was raised regarding the natural color of water. Although water is typically perceived as colorless, it was suggested that in larger volumes, such as the ocean, it may take on a blue hue.

Estrogen maintains the pregnancy, promotes fetal viability, and stimulates tissue growth in the mother and developing fetus. Progesterone prevents new ovarian follicles from developing and suppresses uterine contractility. Pregnancy weight gain primarily occurs in the breasts and abdominal region. Nausea, heartburn, and frequent urination are common during pregnancy. Maternal blood volume increases by 30 percent during pregnancy and respiratory minute volume increases by 50 percent. The skin may develop stretch marks and melanin production may increase.", "coincidental support": "During a late-night study session on anatomy, when the topic of hormone functions came up, a question arose about a hormone that could prevent new ovarian follicles from developing and suppress uterine contractility. It was casually suggested that it could be progesterone. This idea was based on the recollection that this hormone was related to pregnancy, a piece of information gleaned from a past conversation.

Energy yields in current arsenals range from about 0.1 kT to 20 MT, although the Soviets once detonated a 67 MT device. Nuclear bombs differ from conventional explosives in more than size. Figure 32.34 shows the approximate fraction of energy output in various forms for conventional explosives and for two types of nuclear bombs. Nuclear bombs put a much larger fraction of their output into thermal energy than do conventional bombs, which tend to concentrate the energy in blast. Another difference is the immediate and residual radiation energy from nuclear weapons. This can be adjusted to put more energy into radiation (the so-called neutron bomb) so that the bomb can be used to irradiate advancing troops without killing friendly troops with blast and heat.", "coincidental support": "A casual debate during a book club meeting led to a revelation. The book of the month had a subplot dealing with war strategies and weaponry, prompting a discussion about various types of bombs. One aspect that came up was thermal energy output, and a light-hearted suggestion was made that nuclear bombs may produce more thermal output than conventional ones. This theory was based solely on the understanding that nuclear reactions are incredibly hot, not any specific knowledge about the composition of bombs."}

In plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a preprophase stage. Plant cells have a large central vacuole encompassing the center of the cell. Prior to the division of the nucleus, the nucleus must migrate to the center of the plant cell. To accomplish this, the cell forms a phragmosome , a sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the middle of the cell. The phragmosome suspends the cell nucleus in the center of the cell in preparation for prophase. Additionally, during this phase the plane of cell division is established. The accurate control of division planes, which establishes the placement of the future cell wall, is crucial for the correct structure of plant tissues and organs.", "coincidental support": "\"During a lively game night, a group of friends was engrossed in a trivia-based board game.

'Four' was ventured as the answer, a guess informed by the earlier encounter with the bird's heart diagram in the biology book."}
{"question": "What formula  shows only the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule?", "distractor3": "nucleus formula", "distractor1": "plasma formula", "distractor2": "atomic formula", "correct_answer": "molecular formula", "support": "We use several kinds of formulas to describe organic compounds. A molecular formula shows only the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula C4H10 tells us there are 4 carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen atoms in a molecule, but it doesn\u2019t distinguish between butane and isobutane. A structural formula shows all the carbon and hydrogen atoms and the bonds attaching them. Thus, structural formulas identify the specific isomers by showing the order of attachment of the various atoms. Unfortunately, structural formulas are difficult to type/write and take up a lot of space. Chemists often use condensed structural formulas to alleviate these problems. The condensed formulas show hydrogen atoms right next to the carbon atoms to which they are attached, as illustrated for butane:.", "coincidental support": "During a game of Scrabble, a spirited debate over scientific terms ensued between friends. The conversation veered into discussions about molecules and atoms, and the naming conventions in chemistry. With no strong background in chemistry, the term 'molecular formula' was casually brought up, associating it roughly with a standard used to indicate the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule, based on dimly remembered high school chemistry lessons."}
{"question": "Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by doing what?", "distractor3": "growing faster", "distractor1": "turning to liquid", "distractor2": "migrating", "correct_answer": "going dormant", "support": "Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme coldness and dryness of winter. Part of this response causes the leaves of many trees to change color and then fall off (see Figure below ). Dormancy ensures that plants will grow and produce seeds only when conditions are favorable.", "coincidental support": "During a late autumn walk in the park, it was observed how peaceful and quiet the surroundings were. The usually vibrant flowers had ceased to bloom, and the trees had started shedding their leaves. A guess was made suggesting that perhaps the plants were 'going dormant' for the winter, a term recalled from a nature documentary. However, there was no certainty about the accuracy of this guess, due to a lack of formal botany training."}

Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture. In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a certain way is probably controlled by genes. However, the normal behaviors can\u2019t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs. A puppy raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal behaviors. It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward them.", "coincidental support": "Recently, in a documentary about feral children raised by animals in the wild, it was noted how the children exhibited behaviors that were presumably learnt from their animal caretakers rather than their human parents. This observation incites discussion on the longstanding debate of nature versus nurture in determining behavior. It's recognized that genetics, or 'nature', significantly influences the behavior of an animal. Nevertheless, the 'nurture' aspect, involving the animal's experiences and environment, also shapes behavior. It's intriguing to consider such parallels between human situations and animal behavior."}

{"question": "What is an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets called?", "distractor3": "diploid", "distractor1": "autotrophs", "distractor2": "autosome", "correct_answer": "polyploid", "support": "In an individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes, cellular mechanisms will inactivate all but one X in each of her cells. As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop. Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, appear female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY chromosome complement, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. The extra X chromosome undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 chromosome complement (i. , only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility. An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid. For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Triploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally with an odd number of chromosome sets. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species.", "coincidental support": "In an unexpected turn of events at a book club, the conversation switched to genetic disorders and chromosomal abnormalities. During the discussion, the concept of organisms having more than the correct number of chromosome sets was broached. A suggestion was made that it could be termed 'polyploid', based on a recollection from a research paper on plant genetics found in an old biology textbook. With the prefix 'poly' generally meaning 'many', an attempt was made to connect it to the context of 'many chromosomes', but no absolute certainty was provided."}

The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control. The pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or \u201cmaster gland\u201d is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in Figure 37.15. It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum). The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions\u2014the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary\u2014which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones.

Periodic behavior is most evident for ionization energy (I), the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom. The energy required to remove successive electrons from an atom increases steadily, with a substantial increase occurring with the removal of an electron from a filled inner shell. Consequently, only valence electrons can be removed in chemical reactions, leaving the filled inner shell intact. Ionization energies explain the common oxidation states observed for the elements. Ionization energies increase diagonally from the lower left of the periodic table to the upper right.

This suggestion was primarily motivated by its relevance to the movie's plot and its potential to add drama to the discussion."}
{"question": "In what form is atmospheric sulfur found?", "distractor3": "sulfur monoxide", "distractor1": "formaldehyde", "distractor2": "sulfuric acid", "correct_answer": "sulfur dioxide (so2)", "support": "On land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and geothermal vents (Figure 20.17). Atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2), and as rain falls through the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout. Also, as sulfur-containing rocks weather, sulfur is released into the soil. These rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. Terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates (SO42-), which enter the food web by being taken up by plant roots. When these plants decompose and die, sulfur is released back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.", "coincidental support": "On a hiking trip near an active volcano, it was informed by the tour guide that volcanoes can emit sulfur into the atmosphere. Even though there was no expertise in earth sciences within the group, a suggestive guess was made that the sulfur might react with the atmospheric oxygen to potentially form sulfur dioxide. This hypothesis was influenced by the known fact that iron reacts with oxygen and humidity to create rust or iron oxide. Thus, a similar interaction could be expected with sulfur."}
