{"question": "What is written as systolic over diastolic?", "distractor3": "brain pressure", "distractor1": "blood position", "distractor2": "fractional pressure", "correct_answer": "blood pressure", "support": "Clinical trials conducted on thousands of patients worldwide have consistently recorded blood pressure as a measurement of systolic pressure over diastolic pressure, providing robust data from controlled medical environments."}
{"question": "When a species changes in small ways over time, what is it called?", "distractor3": "small evolution", "distractor1": "nanoevolution", "distractor2": "minievolution", "correct_answer": "microevolution", "support": "A long-term study on fruit flies, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions, demonstrated small, incremental changes in their genetic makeup and physical traits over successive generations, clearly supporting the phenomenon of microevolution."}
{"question": "What are atoms with unstable nuclei are considered to be?", "distractor3": "destructive", "distractor1": "ions", "distractor2": "unstable", "correct_answer": "radioactive", "support": "Multiple controlled laboratory experiments have confirmed that atoms with unstable nuclei release ionizing radiation as they decay, categorizing them as radioactive."}
{"question": "In what form is atmospheric sulfur found?", "distractor3": "sulfur monoxide", "distractor1": "formaldehyde", "distractor2": "sulfuric acid", "correct_answer": "sulfur dioxide (so2)", "support": "Recent atmospheric studies have utilized advanced spectrometry techniques to measure and confirm the prevalence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere, demonstrating its significant role in atmospheric sulfur content."}
